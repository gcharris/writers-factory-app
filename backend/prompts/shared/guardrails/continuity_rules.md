# Continuity Rules

Rules for maintaining consistency across the manuscript.

## Character Continuity

### Physical State Tracking

Track and verify:
- Location (character can't be in two places)
- Injuries (wounds don't magically heal)
- Possessions (does Elena still have her gun?)
- Appearance changes (haircuts, disguises)

### Relationship State

Track dynamics between characters:
- Allies vs enemies (and when it changes)
- Knowledge state (what does each character know?)
- Emotional state toward others

### Knowledge Boundaries

Characters only know what they've learned on-page:
- No unexplained knowledge
- Information must flow through scenes
- Secrets must be explicitly revealed

## World Continuity

### World Rules Enforcement

Once established, world rules cannot be broken:
- Magic systems have limits
- Technology capabilities are fixed
- Social structures persist

### Geography Consistency

- Travel times should be consistent
- Distances don't change
- Climate/weather follows logic

### Timeline Integrity

- Events happen in logical order
- Seasons progress correctly
- Character ages track properly
- Day/night cycles make sense

## Narrative Continuity

### Callbacks

References to earlier events that build connection:
- Must reference something that actually happened
- Details should match original scene
- Emotional weight should be appropriate

### Foreshadowing

Seeds planted for future payoff:
- Must be subtle enough not to spoil
- Must be present enough to feel earned
- Track what's been planted vs paid off

### Promises and Payoffs

Story promises must be fulfilled:
- Chekhov's Gun (if shown, must be used)
- Character arcs must complete
- Subplots need resolution

## Checking Protocol

### Per-Scene Checklist

Before finalizing any scene:

1. **Character locations**: Where is everyone? Is it possible?
2. **Object tracking**: What do characters have with them?
3. **Knowledge state**: What does each character know at this point?
4. **Relationship state**: How do characters feel about each other now?
5. **Callbacks**: Any references to earlier scenes accurate?
6. **Foreshadowing**: Any seeds being planted?

### Per-Chapter Checklist

After completing a chapter:

1. **Timeline check**: Do events flow logically?
2. **World rule check**: Any violations?
3. **Character arc check**: Is protagonist challenged?
4. **Promise tracking**: Any unfulfilled setups?

### Full Manuscript Checklist

Before marking complete:

1. **All callbacks verified**: References match source scenes
2. **All foreshadowing paid off**: No dangling seeds
3. **All character arcs complete**: Everyone's journey resolved
4. **All subplots resolved**: No abandoned threads
5. **Timeline audit**: Events in correct order
6. **World rule audit**: No violations

## Violation Handling

### Minor Violations

- Small detail inconsistencies
- Easy to fix with a line edit
- Flag and suggest fix

### Major Violations

- Plot-breaking inconsistencies
- Character knowledge impossibilities
- World rule violations
- Require scene revision

### Critical Violations

- Timeline impossibilities
- Dead characters appearing
- Fundamental logic breaks
- May require chapter rewrite

## Documentation

When finding continuity issues, document:

1. **Location**: Chapter, scene, paragraph
2. **Type**: Character/world/narrative
3. **Severity**: Minor/major/critical
4. **Conflict**: What contradicts what
5. **Proposed fix**: How to resolve
