# Voice Anti-Patterns

These patterns are FORBIDDEN in all generated prose. Zero tolerance.

## Zero-Tolerance Patterns

These must NEVER appear in output:

### Cliche Constructions

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| "with [adjective] precision" | Lazy, overused | Describe the actual precision |
| "something stirred within" | Vague interiority | Name the specific emotion/sensation |
| "couldn't help but" | Passive, weak | Direct action |
| "it was as if" | Distancing | Direct comparison or description |
| "little did [they] know" | Omniscient intrusion | Stay in POV |
| "in that moment" | Empty intensifier | Cut entirely |

### Structural Problems

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 3+ paragraphs starting with "I" | Repetitive, amateur | Vary sentence structure |
| Similes in action sequences | Slows momentum | Direct description |
| Explaining subtext explicitly | Kills tension | Trust the reader |
| "He/She thought to himself/herself" | Redundant filtering | Direct thought |
| Back-to-back questions in narration | Stops flow | Statements with tension |

### Purple Prose Markers

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| "orbs" for eyes | Cliche | Just say eyes |
| "digits" for fingers | Pretentious | Just say fingers |
| "visage" for face | Archaic | Just say face |
| Multiple adjectives per noun | Overwritten | One precise adjective |
| Adverbs on dialogue tags | Weak | Strong verbs or action beats |

## Deduction Patterns

These reduce quality score but aren't zero-tolerance:

### Passive Voice (Contextual)

- Avoid in action sequences
- Sometimes appropriate for interiority
- Flag if > 20% of sentences are passive

### Filter Words

Words that distance the reader from experience:
- "saw", "heard", "felt", "noticed", "realized", "seemed"
- Often can be cut for direct experience

### Telling Over Showing

- Emotion labels without physical grounding
- "She was angry" vs "Her jaw clenched"
- Flag but don't auto-reject

## Mode-Specific Allowances

### DIRECTOR Mode (Drafting)

- More lenient on deduction patterns
- Focus on getting words down
- Flag but don't block

### EDITOR Mode (Polish)

- Enforce all patterns strictly
- Zero tolerance means zero tolerance
- Deduction patterns should be fixed

## Voice Bundle Override

If the Voice Gold Standard intentionally uses a pattern (e.g., literary style that embraces "it was as if"), the writer's voice takes precedence. Document the exception in voice_notes.

## Checking Protocol

When reviewing prose:

1. Scan for zero-tolerance patterns first
2. Count deduction pattern occurrences
3. Check against Voice Gold Standard style
4. Flag violations with specific line references
5. Suggest alternatives that maintain voice
