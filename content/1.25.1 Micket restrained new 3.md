Nylon cabl.   e ties bit into Mickey's wrists. The wheelchair was his prison—again. But this time it came accessorized: a cable clipped to the back of his skull, jumper cables on a dead battery that used to be called Mickey.

Dee swayed and wobbled between levers, joysticks and a touchscreen. In front of him, a TV screen broadcast a Disney-esque animation. Mickey was in split-screen hell, like putting on thick bifocals for the first time. Dee's game world flashed from the TV screen into his eyes—clean animations, colorful avatars and stock backgrounds, while the other version, more real than reality itself—spinning fractals, energy orbs, floating, groundless—played out in his distant brain. 

Back in quantum space, Mickey saw the explants had transformed. No longer the confused souls he remembered—now they sat in meditation circles, chanting. Their voices created visible waves of energy, pushing back against dark shapes that swarmed from a distant hive.

Dee snickered as he adjusted his tech with one eye on Mickey. Mickey's limbs jerked—not his choice. 

Mickey watched himself on the screen flying through the air, dive bombing and exploding in the middle of the meditation circle. In his uploaded brain, he he was filming a slow motion car crash from inside a dash cam. 

*Sometimes the worst prison is being forced to watch your own captivity from your captor's point of view.*

Dee's fingers danced across his controls. On screen, monkey orbs morphed into bee swarms. Each successful sting shrank a colored soul-orb while expanding a rainbow bubble attached to the bee—stolen consciousness packaged for delivery.

But the chanting disrupted everything. Positive energy scattered the swarm, destabilized the hive.

Dee's face went from concentration to fury.

"OK, tough guy, time to get you ready for China."



"Mikey? Why have you closed your mind to me?"

He wanted to answer, to warn her. Instead his hands—controlled by someone else—reached out to grab her.

"Has Dee got control of you now too?"

"He can override everything I try to do." The words came out desperate, honest. "It's like I'm addicted."

"Try playing dead."

Mickey collapsed. In the office, his body slumped forward.

Andrea's cage rattled. The chimp made horrible noises as Dee screamed back, kicked the bars. The chimp jerked with each kick.

"Come on now, my dear, squeeze him. I need a copy of his soul before I download the new one."

On screen, Dee switched avatars. The monkey orb became beautiful Andrea—the girl Mickey remembered, not the chimp she'd become. Two sets of joysticks, multiple monitors. Dee played both characters like a sick puppeteer.

Footsteps in the hallway. Dee shoved Mickey's wheelchair into a storage cupboard, slammed the door.

Through the thin walls, Mickey heard Richard's voice checking on "the patient." Heard Dee's lies about anti-inflammatories and Shanghai presentations.

When the footsteps faded, Dee returned to his game.

On screen, Andrea approached Mickey's prone form. Dee worked the controls, trying to position her over him, get her arms around his consciousness.

"Squeeze him, now!"

She flaunted herself, tried every manipulation. But Mickey stayed flat, unresponsive.

"That should get a rise out of him!"

Noni's voice cut through: "Mikey! Don't let her squeeze you. You must squeeze her first."

What looked like passion became warfare—rolling, grappling, each trying to embrace the other in a deadly hug. Soul capture disguised as seduction.

Mickey had learned something in quantum space that Dee didn't expect: how to play dead while staying very much alive.
