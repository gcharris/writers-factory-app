The equipment storage cupboard was a claustrophobic maze of wires and flashing lights. Mickey sat cramped inside, his bound hands awkwardly extended toward a small computer in a server rack. The cable ties cut into his wrists, but he barely noticed the pain as his focus narrowed to the blinking lights before him.

Colored patterns reflected off the sweat on his face. His expression transformed into one of profound realization—as if directly communicating with some knowledge base, some awareness beyond normal perception. His brow furrowed deeply, his eyes filled with sadness as he shook his head in silent denial.

Taking a steadying breath, Mickey smashed a glass panel with his foot. The sound was shockingly loud in the confined space. He leaned forward with painful effort, picking up a double-edged, dagger-shaped piece of glass and placing it carefully between his legs.

He raised his bound hands, positioning his wrists to bring them down on either side of the jagged shard. His face betrayed his fear—then determination wavered and his hands relaxed, the moment of resolution passing. He drew another breath, raised his hands again, his expression hardening into singular focus.

The glass was positioned horizontally—not to cut the cable ties, but to slash his wrists.

In the quantum world, Noni and the explants watched from a distance as Andrea and Mickey continued their desperate struggle, consciousness forms locked in combat that would determine their fates.

In the physical world, Mickey's hands trembled above his head, his entire body vibrating with tension.

"Dear God, please give me the courage to carry your will," he prayed, his voice barely audible. "Dee will never get my soul. I pray Noni and the others might someday download my soul into another body. Please not a chimpanzee! Though perhaps a female chimpanzee might work. May Thy Will be done."

His hands hung suspended, shaking with effort. Then they descended in a violent motion, slashing across his wrists. Blood poured immediately, spattering the confined space with crimson droplets.

A primeval scream tore from his throat: "Ahhhh —"

In the quantum world, Mickey's consciousness finally managed to get his arms around Andrea. Like the culmination of an intimate act, his mental voice cried out: "— Ahhhh!"

Mickey fell back as the scream reverberated through both realities. In the quantum space, Andrea morphed into a balloon attached to Mickey's consciousness form, which now lay prone but triumphant.

In the physical world, Mickey slumped in the wheelchair, suffering involuntary spasms. His partially severed hands twitched beside the jagged glass that stood erect between his legs. Blood pooled beneath him, spreading across the floor in an expanding crimson circle.

Back in the quantum realm, Mickey regained awareness as the balloon pulled him upward. He floated along, following other retreating dark orbs holding balloons. As he passed Noni, he gestured for her and the others to follow his unexpected trajectory.

In his office, Dee frantically worked his controls as his monitor slowly faded to gray. He banged his joysticks in frustration and kicked Andrea's cage with mindless rage.

"Open your eyes! I can't see anything!" he screamed, his scientific detachment completely abandoned.

He ran from the room, still whacking the monkey cage as he passed, his control—both technological and emotional—disintegrating as Mickey's desperate gambit succeeded.
