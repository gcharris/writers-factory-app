The UNRCAC loading dock lay in shadow. Henry worked quickly, helping the Chinese cleaning staff load the last laundry-covered boxes into the back of a white van. The vehicle was already sitting low on its suspension, heavy with cargo concealed beneath institutional linens. They all worked together as a team—this wasn't their first rodeo.

A wheel of a laundry cart got stuck between the dock and the van. Henry tensed, eyes darting toward the facility's dark windows.

It took all of them, heaving together, to force the cart into the van. They worked in silence, the only sound their labored breathing.

Henry waved as the others closed the rear doors. He watched them climb into the vehicle, then stepped back from the dock into the shadows.

The van pulled away, taillights receding down the service road toward the security post that marked the facility's perimeter.

The guard's professional gaze noted the vehicle's excessive weight, the way it sat too low on its suspension. He approached the driver's window.

"Carrying some heavy cargo tonight," he commented. "Please, open up the back."

The driver nodded and exited. As they moved toward the rear, the passenger slipped out unnoticed, vanishing into shadows beyond the floodlights.

The guard leaned forward to inspect the neatly stacked laundry. In that moment of focused attention, the driver struck the base of his neck. The guard collapsed without sound, caught before hitting the ground.

With methodical movements, the driver deposited the unconscious body in the van among the laundry bags. He took the guard's magnetic key, walking purposefully to the security post.

The electronic lock yielded with a soft CLICK. The driver dropped the key through the window before returning to the van.

He pulled through the open gate, accelerating gently onto the access road. The rearview mirror showed no pursuit, only the facility's lights gradually diminishing behind them.

"No one following," he noted to his passenger, who had rematerialized beside him.

At the security post, the passenger appeared from the shadows. He stripped off his white coveralls, revealing a guard uniform underneath that matched the unconscious man's attire perfectly.

He entered the small booth and began typing. The security logs disappeared from the screen erasing all evidence of the van's passage. Timestamps, gate records, and camera footage vanished with a few keystrokes.

He picked up the magnetic key and put it around his neck. His posture shifted subtly, adopting the alert but relaxed stance of regular security personnel.

To anyone watching through surveillance, the post appeared normally staffed, the perimeter secure. The infiltration was invisible, the escape unrecorded.
