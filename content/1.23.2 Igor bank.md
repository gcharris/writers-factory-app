The computer center was mostly empty, but clacki ng of keyboards pointed to a few people hunched over their workstations. At one of the stations, a man sat perfectly still, his focus directed not at his own screen, but at the reflection of the room in the monitor's shiny screen protector.

Igor straightened as he saw Liang enter, his expression transforming from private concentration to professional scientist.

"Testing your side channel, Igor?" Liang asked, his tone casual, as he came up beside him.

Igor's broad shoulders squared defensively. "Is not a side channel. Is very sophisticated peer-to-peer network. My friend in Moscow is network genius. We are developing new protocol for anonymous fund transfers."

"Oh, so it's only able to send money," Liang sighed mischievously, "I only wish I had some to send."

Pride puffed up Igor's already rounded body. "But the financial layer runs on top of the non-detectable peer-to-peer.  We bypass all Western monitoring systems."

"So it's also a data network," Liang probed, "and it routes through Moscow. So it's secure and completely private, yes?"

"Is military-grade encryption," Igor assured him. "No one can intercept. Is like private tunnel straight to Russia. My friend, he has connections to satellite infrastructure that even Americans don't know about."

They shared a smile of mutual approval on this point, though Igor didn't realize that Igor's "Russian satellite infrastructure" was actually something quite different. Igor had suspected something when his P2P was still functional after the facility came under total communication lockdown. A wink from Ben at the time made his suspicions clear, but he prefered to attribute his successes to his Russian genius friend.

"I believe you," Liang said finally. "But I need that channel kept clear until tomorrow. No traffic."

Igor's posture stiffened and then deflated along with his pride. "Is not possible. I am running diagnostics for my currency conversion project. I need constant access."

Liang moved closer, lowering his voice to create an artificial intimacy. "Can I trust you with an important state secret?"

The question transformed Igor's demeanor instantly. He drew himself up with self-importance, his chest expanding. "I am trained to withstand all torture. My mouth is zipped." He pantomimed closing his lips and throwing away an imaginary key.

"I am being promoted," Liang confided, the words carefully measured. "My work here is done. I will not be returning from Shanghai. I wish to hand over responsibility for my research portfolio to you."

Igor's face brightened with undisguised pleasure. "No better man for the job. I am not like you famous quantum physicist, but I know enough to manage the project."

"As my successor," Liang continued smoothly, "you will need access to my private network to finalize the data transfer after I have departed. I need time now to get that all set up for you before I leave."

Puffing up again up with this newfound importance, Igor reached for a pad of sticky notes. "Of course. Is necessary." He scribbled a username and a complex password onto a fresh sheet followed by some network address numbers. "This is the primary node for my P2P network. Very secure."

He tore the note from the pad and held it out. Liang took it, his fingers closing around the paper with a kind, but mysterious smile.

"Thank you, Igor. For your loyalty."

As Liang departed, he gently exhaled. He had solved one of his biggest challenges. At least the Chinese system would be fully updated and running before he got to Shanghai. The last big challenge was to make sure those two new volunteers would be ready to accompany him—the living vessels for the *'Queen Bee' and 'Worker Bee'* templates.

The man in the corner finally looked down at his own keyboard. It was Henry. He typed a single, encrypted message into a secure terminal: *The target has the bait*.
