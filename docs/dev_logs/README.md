# Development Logs

**Purpose**: Chronological implementation logs, completion summaries, and session handoff notes

---

## Overview

This folder contains **implementation logs** documenting the development journey of Writers Factory. Each log captures:
- Implementation details (what was built, how it works)
- Test results and validation
- Strategic decisions and trade-offs
- Handoff notes for continuing work

## Organization

## Log Retention Policy

**All dev_logs are retained indefinitely** as they serve as:
1. **Historical record** of implementation decisions
2. **Reference documentation** for understanding "why" decisions were made
3. **Handoff context** for resuming work after breaks
4. **Learning resource** for understanding the development process

## Reading Guide

### For Understanding Current State
Start with the most recent completion summaries:
1. **PHASE_3_ORCHESTRATOR_COMPLETION.md** - Latest phase (Model Orchestrator)
2. **PHASE_3E_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Phase 3E Phases 1-2
3. **PHASE_3D_GRAPH_HEALTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Ongoing work

### For Understanding Development Process
Read chronologically from earliest to latest to see the evolution.

### For Specific Features
Use the phase groupings above to find relevant logs.
