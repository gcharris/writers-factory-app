# 🚫 Anti-Patterns: How to Fail at AI Writing

> **"Success is not about being smart. It's about avoiding stupidity."** — Charlie Munger

In the Writers Factory, we don't just teach you what to do. We teach you what *not* to do. These are the "Anti-Patterns"—the common mistakes that scream "I used an LLM to write this."

---

## 1. The "Wikipedia Voice" (Regressing to the Mean)
**The Mistake:** Asking the AI to "describe" something without a specific angle.
**The Result:** The AI produces a generic, balanced, "encyclopedic" description. It sounds like a corporate press release or a Wikipedia summary.
**The Fix:** Never ask for a description. Ask for an *opinion*.
*   *Bad:* "Describe the casino."
*   *Good:* "Describe the casino from the perspective of a recovering addict who hates the smell of cheap perfume."

## 2. The Adjective Stacking
**The Mistake:** Believing that more adjectives = better writing.
**The Result:** "The **stunning, breathtaking, intricate** tapestry of the **vibrant, bustling** city."
**The Fix:** The "One Adjective Rule." If you use more than one adjective per noun, the AI is hallucinating quality. Delete them.

## 3. The "Delve" Trap
**The Mistake:** Ignoring the AI's favorite words.
**The Result:** Certain words are statistically over-represented in LLM training data. If your character "delves" into a mystery, "fosters" a relationship, or "underscores" a point, you have been caught.
**The List of Forbidden Words:**
*   *Delve*
*   *Tapestry*
*   *Testament*
*   *Pivotal*
*   *Nuance*
*   *Underscore*

## 4. The "Context Window" Cliff
**The Mistake:** Trusting the AI to remember Chapter 1 when you are writing Chapter 10.
**The Result:** Your protagonist's eyes change color. The dead villain comes back to life. The plot dissolves.
**The Fix:** **Trust the Graph.** If it's not in the Knowledge Graph, it doesn't exist. Never assume the AI remembers anything outside the current session.

## 5. The "Pantsing" Fallacy
**The Mistake:** Trying to "discover" the story by chatting with the AI endlessly.
**The Result:** You get a 50,000-word rambling mess with no structure.
**The Fix:** **Structure First.** Build the Beat Sheet. Define the Ending. Then, and only then, let the AI draft the scenes.

> **Final Rule:** If you find yourself reading a sentence and thinking, "That sounds nice but means nothing," **delete it.** That is the sound of the machine humming.
