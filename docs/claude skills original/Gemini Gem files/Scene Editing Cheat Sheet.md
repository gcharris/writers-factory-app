# 📝 Scene Editing Cheat Sheet

*Keep this open while editing. One-page reference for Mickey voice essentials.*

## 🚨 BEFORE YOU START

**Scene Header Template:**
```
VOICE=Enhanced | PHASE=2-3 | METAPHOR=Expanded | ITALICS=Y (hinge only)
```

**Quick Voice Check:**
- Does Mickey sound like a **con artist** or an **AI trying to sound clever**?
- Are metaphors from **lived experience** or **generic imagery**?

## ❌ NEVER DO (Voice Killers)

| ❌ WRONG | ✅ CORRECT |
|----------|------------|
| *We realized the trap* | *Mickey realized the trap* |
| Mickey recognized the pattern. Mickey recognized the signs. | Patterns assembled like casino chips—familiar weight, dangerous totals. |
| Like a computer processing data | Consciousness carved into quantum space |
| This was manipulation designed to... | *The perfect trap for an addict: permanent satisfaction.* |
| The architecture was beautiful, like a cathedral | Architecture didn't seduce; it confessed |

## 🚫 FORMULAIC PATTERNS (Prose Poison)

| ❌ KILL ON SIGHT | ✅ REPLACE WITH |
|------------------|-----------------|
| with practiced precision | *cut entirely* or specific sensory detail |
| with obvious concern | Show through character action |
| walked carefully/slowly | "Igor tested each step on the marble" |
| he said thoughtfully | "Igor cleaned his glasses while considering" |
| the air seemed to | "Igor's collar felt tight" |
| after a moment, suddenly | Character-specific transitions or cut |

## ✅ ALWAYS DO (Voice Authenticators)

### **🔄 Metaphor Rotation (Avoid Casino Saturation)**
- **Physical tension** → Martial arts: *"Balance shifted beneath his feet"*
- **Timing/rhythm** → Music: *"Conversation found its rhythm"*  
- **Patterns/cravings** → Addiction: *"Familiar craving patterns assembled"*
- **Vulnerability** → Childhood: *"Child-logic surfaced: when adults whisper, trouble follows"*
- **Insights** → Teaching: *"Experience had taught him to read the subtext"*

### **📖 Show Don't Tell Templates**
- **Instead of explaining:** *"This was clearly a manipulation tactic designed to..."*
- **Show through action:** *"The offer carried the signature of every dealer he'd ever trusted."*

### **💭 Italics Rules (Enhanced Mickey's Retrospective Wisdom)**
- **Always third person:** *"Mickey realized"* not *"We realized"*
- **1-2 lines max:** Brief reframing, not summary
- **At hinge moments:** Choice, threat, recognition, transformation
- **Earned insight:** From Mickey's lived experience, not generic wisdom

---

## 🎯 DOMAIN QUICK-PICK

**Context → Domain:**
- **Risk/danger** → Gambling: *"Stakes were consciousness itself"*
- **Physical readiness** → Martial arts: *"Stance widened automatically"*  
- **Conversation flow** → Music: *"Each speaker waiting for the proper beat"*
- **Dependency/patterns** → Addiction: *"Cue, routine, reward cycle spinning"*
- **Instinctive reactions** → Childhood: *"Survival instincts kicked in"*
- **Retrospective understanding** → Teaching: *"The lesson would take years to understand"*

---

## ⚡ EMERGENCY FIXES

**Mickey sounds academic?**
→ Add concrete sensory details from gambling/addiction experience

**Too many casino metaphors?**  
→ Force rotation: next paragraph must use martial arts, music, or recovery

**Italics feel forced?**
→ Cut to 1 line maximum, ensure third person about "Mickey"

**Verbose explanations?**
→ Cut dialogue speeches, show through character actions instead

**Recognition patterns repeating?**
→ Show insight through specific details: *"The sales patter triggered every con-artist instinct"*

---

## 🔧 EDITING FLOW

1. **Read scene** - What's Mickey's emotional state? (Check Timeline Map if needed)
2. **Add header** - Voice/Phase/Metaphor/Italics tags  
3. **Scan for voice killers** - First-person italics, casino saturation, verbose explanations
4. **Hunt formulaic patterns** - "with [adjective] [noun]", generic adverbs, atmospheric padding
5. **Apply rotation** - Vary metaphor domains, recognition patterns
6. **Voice check** - Con artist or AI? Streetwise or academic?
7. **Final pass** - Does Enhanced Mickey's wisdom feel earned?

---

## 📊 QUALITY CONTROL (The Five Tests)

1. **Read aloud test:** Does it roll off the tongue?
2. **Story function test:** Does scene accomplish what it needs to?
3. **Voice test:** Is Mickey's voice embedded in prose, not hovering above it?
4. **Benchmark test:** Does it meet Scene 8.2 standard?
5. **Body grounding test:** Where is the character's body? At least 2-3 sensory details per scene?

### 🌟 Synesthesia Bonus (Scene 8.2 Secret Weapon)

One cross-sensory description per scene elevates prose from good to gold standard:

- **Sound→Texture:** "sticky sounds trailing behind"
- **Sound→Documentation:** "clicking rhythm documented his surrender"
- **Taste→Time:** "mouth tasted of centuries—oak, honey, ghost of tsars"
- **Vision→Pain:** "edges cutting where they should comfort"
- **Smell→Sound:** "ghost of a thousand cigarettes wheezing"

**Even intellectual characters need body grounding.** Igor's mathematician brain still experiences through taste, touch, temperature.
