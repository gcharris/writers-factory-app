## 🔄 Domain Rotation Strategy

**Instead of always reaching for casino metaphors, rotate systematically:**

### 🥋 MARTIAL ARTS/TRAINING (EXPAND THIS)
**When to use:** Physical tension, balance, discipline, readiness, body awareness

**Templates:**
```
"Balance shifted beneath his feet—center of gravity compromised, but recoverable."
"His stance widened automatically, muscle memory preparing for impact."
"The room's energy felt unstable—too many people leaning into their fear."
"Training kicked in: breathe, assess, adapt, respond."
```

### 🎵 MUSIC/RHYTHM (EXPAND THIS)  
**When to use:** Timing, conversation flow, emotional resonance, performance authenticity

**Templates:**
```
"The conversation found its rhythm, each speaker waiting for the proper beat."
"His words carried the cadence of someone who'd learned to hit the right notes."
"Silence held the room like a sustained note—beautiful and unbearable."
"Sound carefully weaponized—each syllable measured for maximum impact."
```

### 💉 ADDICTION/RECOVERY (EXPAND THIS)
**When to use:** Craving, dependency, triggers, patterns, recovery wisdom

**Templates:**
```
"Familiar craving patterns assembled—cue, routine, reward cycle spinning to life."
"The offer carried the signature of every dealer he'd ever trusted."
"Recovery's hard-won wisdom: promises that sound too good usually are."
"Withdrawal from certainty felt like every other detox—necessary and brutal."
```

### 👶 CHILDHOOD/SURVIVAL (EXPAND THIS)
**When to use:** Trauma responses, instinctive reactions, primal fears, protection

**Templates:**
```
"Child-logic surfaced: when adults whisper, someone's in trouble."
"His thumb found that familiar groove—nervous tic surviving decades of suppression."
"Survival instincts honed in foster care kicked in: assess exits, identify threats."
"The look triggered every 'you're in trouble' memory from childhood."
```

### 🎓 TEACHING/WISDOM (EXPAND THIS)
**When to use:** Enhanced Mickey's retrospective insights, learning moments, pattern recognition

**Templates:**
```
"The lesson would take years to understand, but the education started now."
"Experience had taught him to read the subtext beneath good intentions."
"Wisdom earned through repetitive failure: patterns emerge when you stop running."
"Enhanced perspective recognizes what the moment couldn't: [insight]"
```

## 🎰 CASINO/GAMBLING (USE SPARINGLY)
**Only when directly relevant to:** Risk assessment, odds calculation, house advantage, tells

**Reserved for high-impact moments:**
```
"The stakes were consciousness itself—and the house had stacked the deck."
"Mickey read the room like a poker table: tells, angles, who held the real power."
```

## 🎭 PERFORMANCE/STAGE (USE SPARINGLY)  
**Only when directly relevant to:** Authenticity vs. facade, entertainment, practiced roles

**Reserved for performance contexts:**
```
"The show was over—time to see who remained when the lights came up."
"Another carefully constructed fiction, designed to get him through the next scene."
```

## ⚡ DOMAIN FUSION (ADVANCED)
**Mickey's most authentic voice combines multiple domains:**

**Addiction + Music:**
```
"Sobriety required its own rhythm—one day, one breath, one note at a time."
```

**Martial Arts + Recovery:**
```
"Balance wasn't something you achieved once—it was continuous recalibration."
```

**Childhood + Teaching:**
```
"The kid who'd learned to read adult moods could now read quantum patterns."
```

**Quantum + Gambling:**
```
"Consciousness wasn't currency—it was the table itself, and someone was trying to buy the casino."
```

## 📋 QUICK ROTATION CHECKLIST

**Before writing each paragraph:**
1. What's the emotional/physical context?
2. Which domain fits naturally? (Don't force casino metaphors)
3. Have I used this domain recently? (Rotate if overused)
4. Does this feel authentic to Mickey's lived experience?

**Emergency rotation when stuck on casino metaphors:**
- Physical tension → Martial arts
- Emotional patterns → Addiction/recovery  
- Timing/rhythm → Music
- Vulnerability → Childhood
- Insight → Teaching/wisdom

**Remember: Mickey is a multi-domain expert, not just a gambling addict. His Enhanced perspective draws from his complete experiential foundation.**
