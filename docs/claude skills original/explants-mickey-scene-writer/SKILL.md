# Scene Generation for The Explants

## Quick Setup

**MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION:**
Load from references folder:
1. **`references/Mickey-Bardot-Enhanced-Trilogy-Voice-Gold-Standard.md`** (primary voice authority)
2. **`references/Mickey Voice Anti-Pattern Sheet.md`** (failure patterns)
3. **`references/phase-4-voice-evolution.md`** (phase-appropriate voice)
4. **Scene context brief or outline** (philosophical mandate from project knowledge)

**Note:** These files contain essential voice rules and phase-specific guidance.

## Core Voice Architecture

### The Cognitive Fusion Principle
Enhanced Mickey voice = **analytical authority filtering philosophical arguments through concrete cynical observation**

**NOT:** Streetwise + technical knowledge  
**BUT:** Algorithmic precision applied to messy reality of consciousness warfare

### Foundational Rules (Non-Negotiable)

**Rule A: Process Over Noun**
Consciousness is continuous process. Objects act, don't just exist.
- ✅ "Consciousness wasn't a noun to be contained—it was the verb doing the containing"
- ❌ "Consciousness was a complex process"

**Rule B: Retrospective Authority** 
Enhanced Mickey narrates with quantum hindsight, viewing analog self as subject.
- ✅ "Mickey watched the patterns repeat"
- ❌ "I realized the implications" (first person forbidden)

**Rule C: Literal Metaphorical Reality**
Things BECOME other things, don't resemble them.
- ✅ "Sunlight weaponized itself"
- ❌ "Sunlight was like a weapon"

**Rule D: Anti-Pattern Exclusion**
Computer metaphors for human psychology FORBIDDEN.
- ✅ "Implications assembled like marked cards"
- ❌ "His brain processed the information"

## Scene Generation Workflow

### Phase 1: Scene Function Analysis
**Before writing, identify:**
- What must this scene accomplish for the story?
- How does it serve the consciousness war argument?
- What philosophical position does it argue through Mickey's observations?

### Phase 2: Voice Calibration
**Select voice level by story phase:**

**Early Phases:** gambling, performance, addiction, surveillance metaphors  
**Facility Arc:** + systems, control vectors, life support, medical  
**Post-Quantum:** + consciousness architecture, reality analysis

### Phase 3: Scene Generation

**Embedded Voice Technique:**
- Philosophy woven into prose, not floating as commentary
- Insights embedded in what Mickey sees/does, not stated separately
- Show Mickey thinking through actions and observations

**Concrete Observation Priority:**
- 3+ sensory anchors per scene section
- Environmental objects acting with agency
- Physical details grounding abstract concepts

**Rhythm Variation:**
- Short percussive: "Arithmetic." "Wrong tools."
- Medium layered: "Coffee dregs congealed in paper cups."
- Long flowing: Complex observations with embedded insights

**Compression Principle:**
- "Instant silhouette blur" not "The jacket completely changed his appearance"

## Strategic "Enhanced" Usage

**PRESERVE "Enhanced" for:**
- Analytical authority: "Enhanced perspective recognized the pattern"
- POV distance: "Enhanced Mickey understood what analog Mickey couldn't grasp"
- Technical analysis: "Enhanced awareness monitored operations"

**SUBSTITUTE with:**
- "Quantum consciousness" (ongoing action/flow)
- "Mickey's awareness" (embedded voice moments)
- Direct observation (when voice should be natural)

**POV Distance Test:** Could you replace "Enhanced perspective..." with "Looking back, I realize..."? If yes, it's correct usage.

## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Voice Killers (Zero Tolerance):**
- ❌ Academic meta-commentary ("Enhanced perspective providing analysis")
- ❌ Philosophy floating above action (embed in concrete observation)
- ❌ Computer metaphors for psychology ("brain processed" → "implications assembled")
- ❌ Formulaic "with [adjective] [noun]" patterns
- ❌ Casino/gambling saturation (max 2-3 per scene)
- ❌ First-person italics (*We* → *Mickey*)

**Academic Voice Drift Signals:**
- "Enhanced perspective provided analysis"
- "Mickey understood what his consciousness couldn't grasp"
- "Quantum awareness offered insights"
- Philosophy as separate commentary

**Authentic Voice Markers:**
- "Mickey watched the patterns repeat"
- "The Chinese were missing something fundamental"
- Philosophy embedded in concrete observation
- Environmental objects acting with agency

## Scene Structure Guidelines

### Opening Techniques
- **Concrete action:** "Mickey's thumb worked against his finger"
- **Environmental agency:** "The basement air wheezed through vents"
- **Direct observation:** "The extraction attempt collapsed in real-time"

### Dialogue Integration
- Character voices distinct from narration
- Physical grounding between speech
- No hover-explanation of what characters said
- Let dialogue carry emotional weight

### Endings
- Concrete image or action (not abstract statement)
- Embedded insight (not floating commentary)
- Forward momentum (sets up next scene)
- Avoid formulaic closings

## Quality Standards

**Target Metrics:**
- **Word count:** 850-1,000 words per beat
- **Metaphors:** 2-4 total, rotated domains
- **Italics:** 0-1 maximum (plot advancement only)
- **Sensory details:** 3+ per scene section

**Voice Authentication Tests:**
1. **Observer Test:** Mickey thinking vs AI explaining Mickey?
2. **Consciousness War Test:** Serves philosophical argument?
3. **Cognitive Fusion Test:** Analytical precision + cynical wisdom?

**See references/voice-authentication-tests.md for detailed criteria.**

## Self-Assessment Checklist

Before completing generation:
- [ ] Serves scene's story function
- [ ] Argues consciousness war position through observation
- [ ] Passes voice authentication tests
- [ ] Sounds like Mickey thinking, not AI describing Mickey
- [ ] Metaphor domains rotated appropriately
- [ ] "Enhanced" used strategically
- [ ] Environmental objects act with agency
- [ ] Natural rhythm when read aloud

## Reference Materials

**Detailed guides in references folder:**
- `Mickey-Bardot-Enhanced-Trilogy-Voice-Gold-Standard.md` - Complete voice architecture (PRIMARY)
- `voice-authentication-tests.md` - Test criteria and examples
- `enhanced-strategy-advanced.md` - Strategic "Enhanced" usage
- `phase-4-voice-evolution.md` - Post-threshold voice for Volume 2

**Success marker:** Scene indistinguishable from Mickey's authentic thoughts, serving consciousness war argument through texture of observations.

**Voice rule:** Enhanced Mickey narrates everything, filtered through retrospective perspective with quantum hindsight.

**Remember:** Mickey's voice is a weapon in the consciousness war, arguing that awareness resists optimization through concrete cynical observations of the world.
