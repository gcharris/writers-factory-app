# 📤 How to Submit Your Work

> **"Shipping is a feature."**

Because this course is hosted on GitHub, we don't use a "file upload" form. We use **Pull Requests**. This ensures your work is permanently archived in the repository's history.

*Best for: Engineers and those who want the "Contributor" badge.*

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the `Fork` button at the top right of the GitHub page.
2.  **Add Your File:**
    *   Upload your PDF/EPUB to `docs/assets/student_projects/`.
    *   Name it clearly: `Title_YourName.pdf`.
3.  **Update the Showcase:**
    *   Edit `docs/showcase.md`.
    *   Add a new "Book Card" entry for your project (copy an existing one).
    *   Link it to your file: `{{ '/assets/student_projects/Title_YourName.pdf' | relative_url }}`.
4.  **Open a Pull Request:**
    *   Commit your changes.
    *   Open a PR against the `main` branch.
