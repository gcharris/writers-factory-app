# Two Tracks, One Goal

Writers Factory offers two distinct paths through the course. Both tracks produce the same deliverable: a complete novella. The difference is in how you engage with the technology.

<div class="track-grid">
  <div class="track-card writer">
    <h3>The Writer Track</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">For novelists who want to focus on the creative output</p>

    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Complete a 15k+ word novella</li>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Use the app as-is</li>
      <li><strong>Technical:</strong> None required</li>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Story, characters, voice</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You'll work with the Foreman AI to develop your Story Bible, calibrate your voice, and draft scenes. The technology fades into the background while you focus on what matters: your story.</p>

  <div class="track-card architect">
    <h3>The Architect Track</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">For engineers who want to understand and improve the system</p>

    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Optimize the Context Engine</li>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Modify prompts, graph logic, configs</li>
      <li><strong>Technical:</strong> Python, TypeScript, LLM APIs</li>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Architecture, prompts, performance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You'll dive into the codebase, understand how the Knowledge Graph maintains continuity, and submit improvements. Your novella becomes a test case for your optimizations.</p>

## What's the Difference?

| Aspect | Writer Track | Architect Track |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Daily focus** | Writing scenes, developing characters | Reading code, modifying prompts |
| **Success metric** | Compelling story | Measurable improvements |
| **Technical depth** | User-level | Developer-level |
| **Collaboration** | With AI partner | With AI + codebase |
| **Final artifact** | Novella manuscript | Novella + Pull Requests |

## Can I Switch Tracks?

Yes. Many participants start as Writers and become curious about the internals. Others start as Architects and get pulled into their story. The tracks are guidelines, not prisons.

The only requirement: everyone produces a novella. The Architect Track simply adds technical contributions on top.

## Which Track Is Right for Me?

**Choose Writer if:**
- You're here primarily to write fiction
- You want the AI to "just work"
- Technical details distract you from creativity
- You've never used a terminal and don't want to start

**Choose Architect if:**
- You're fascinated by how LLMs maintain context
- You want to understand prompt engineering deeply
- You enjoy debugging and optimization
- You see the novella as a means to test your improvements
