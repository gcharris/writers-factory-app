# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>What background do I need?</summary>
<p>For the <strong>Writer Track</strong>: No technical background required. If you can use a word processor, you can use Writers Factory. You should have some interest in fiction writing and be willing to engage with AI as a creative partner.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Architect Track</strong>: Familiarity with Python and/or TypeScript. Understanding of APIs and basic software architecture. Curiosity about LLMs and prompt engineering.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to know how to code?</summary>
<p>Not for the Writer Track. The application handles all the technical complexity. You interact through natural language conversations with the Foreman AI.</p>
<p>The Architect Track requires coding skills, as you'll be modifying the codebase directly.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How intensive is the week?</summary>
<p>Very. This is an immersive experience. Expect 8-10 hours of focused work per day. The compressed timeline is intentional - it creates urgency that pushes through perfectionism and procrastination.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the daily schedule?</summary>
<p>Each day follows a rhythm:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Brief group check-in, then focused work</li>
  <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Deep work continues, optional office hours</li>
  <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Share progress, address blockers</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific activities depend on which phase you're in (Architect, Voice, Director, Editor).</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What will I produce?</summary>
<p>Everyone produces a complete novella of 15,000+ words. This is a first draft - polished enough to share, rough enough to improve later.</p>
<p>Architect Track participants also contribute technical improvements (bug fixes, prompt optimizations, documentation) via Pull Requests.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How is work evaluated?</summary>
<p>There are no grades in the traditional sense. Success means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Completing your novella manuscript</li>
  <li>Engaging with the methodology (Story Bible, Voice Calibration, etc.)</li>
  <li>Participating in daily check-ins</li>
  <li>For Architects: Submitting at least one meaningful PR</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What AI models are used?</summary>
<p>Writers Factory supports multiple AI providers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ollama (local):</strong> Llama 3.2, Mistral - no API costs</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud:</strong> Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek</li>
</ul>
<p>The Foreman (your primary AI partner) runs on Ollama by default, so core functionality works without paid APIs.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to pay for API access?</summary>
<p>Not necessarily. The core experience uses Ollama (local, free). Cloud APIs are optional for advanced features. If you want to use Claude or GPT-4o for scene generation, you'll need your own API keys.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if I get stuck?</summary>
<p>The Foreman AI is designed to help you through blocks. It will challenge weak ideas, suggest alternatives, and maintain context across your entire project. If you're truly stuck, instructors are available during office hours.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use my own story idea?</summary>
<p>Absolutely. You should come with a concept you're excited about. The methodology works best when you have genuine passion for your story. However, be prepared for the Foreman to challenge and refine your initial ideas.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens to my manuscript after the course?</summary>
<p>It's yours. You retain full rights to everything you create. The application stores everything locally on your machine. Nothing is sent to external servers without your explicit action.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is the source code open?</summary>
<p>Yes. Writers Factory is open source. Architect Track participants contribute directly to the repository. Even Writer Track participants can explore the code if curiosity strikes.</p>
