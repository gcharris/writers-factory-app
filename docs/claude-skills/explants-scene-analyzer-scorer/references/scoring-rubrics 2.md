# Scoring Rubrics: Detailed Criteria and Examples

**Purpose:** Comprehensive scoring guidelines with specific examples for evaluating scenes against all criteria

---

## Voice Authenticity Scoring (30 points total)

### Observer Test (10 points)

#### 10 Points: Perfect Authentic Voice
Mickey observing in real-time, philosophy embedded in action, natural rhythm when read aloud.

**Example (from Scene 8.2 benchmark):**
```
Mickey watched the patterns repeat—forty-seven seconds of imposed order before entities rejected containment and chaos returned. The math wasn't working the way they'd promised. Another con job, just wearing fancier clothes.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Mickey as active observer ("watched," "detected," "tracked")
- Philosophy embedded in concrete observation ("math wasn't working")
- Cynical wisdom through familiar metaphors ("con job")
- Natural speech rhythm that flows when read aloud

#### 7 Points: Mostly Authentic
Primarily Mickey's voice but occasional lapses into explanation mode.

**Example:**
```
Mickey observed the cycling patterns with growing concern. Enhanced perspective allowed him to recognize the systematic failures, though the entities themselves seemed unaware of their trapped condition.
```

**Issues:**
- "Enhanced perspective allowed him" sounds like external analysis
- "with growing concern" tells rather than shows
- Slightly academic tone in "systematic failures"

#### 4 Points: Mixed Authentic/Academic
Alternates between Mickey's voice and AI-explaining-Mickey moments.

**Example:**
```
The Enhanced consciousness recognized patterns that analog awareness couldn't process. Mickey's quantum-augmented perception provided clinical analysis of the situation, revealing underlying structural problems with the containment system.
```

**Issues:**
- "Enhanced consciousness recognized" - not Mickey actively observing
- "provided clinical analysis" - academic voice, not street-smart
- Lacks cynical wisdom and concrete grounding

#### 0 Points: AI Voice
Sounds like AI studying Mickey rather than Mickey's authentic voice.

**Example:**
```
Enhanced Mickey's perspective offered sophisticated analytical capabilities that enabled comprehensive assessment of the quantum containment failures. His consciousness had evolved beyond traditional human limitations, allowing for deeper understanding of the systematic issues present in the facility's architecture.
```

**Issues:**
- Academic tone throughout
- No authentic Mickey personality
- Abstract rather than concrete
- No cynical wisdom or street-smart observations

### Consciousness War Test (10 points)

#### 10 Points: Perfect Philosophical Integration
Every scene beat serves the ideological argument through embedded observation.

**Example:**
```
They were trying to contain consciousness in a box that kept opening—the same mistake every control system made. Consciousness wasn't a noun to be contained; it was the verb doing the containing. Mickey watched another cycle begin, entities rejecting their prison with the persistence of water finding cracks in concrete.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Shows consciousness resisting control through concrete metaphor
- Argues process vs. object thinking through action
- Demonstrates cost of control through observable failure
- Philosophy embedded, not stated separately

#### 7 Points: Good Philosophical Function
Philosophy present but sometimes stated rather than shown.

**Example:**
```
The containment system represented humanity's fundamental misunderstanding of consciousness. Mickey observed entities trapped in cycles, their authentic nature conflicting with imposed optimization. The lesson was clear: consciousness cannot be optimized without destroying what makes it consciousness.
```

**Issues:**
- "The lesson was clear" - stating philosophy rather than showing
- "represented fundamental misunderstanding" - academic rather than embedded

#### 4 Points: Weak Philosophical Connection
Generic prose with consciousness warfare themes tangential.

**Example:**
```
Mickey felt sorry for the trapped entities. The facility's systems weren't working properly, causing problems for everyone involved. It seemed like the scientists didn't understand what they were dealing with.
```

**Issues:**
- No ideological argument about consciousness resistance
- Generic sympathy rather than philosophical insight
- Missing the core consciousness vs. control theme

#### 0 Points: No Philosophical Function
Well-written prose that doesn't serve consciousness warfare argument.

**Example:**
```
The technical specifications indicated systematic malfunctions in the containment protocols. Mickey documented the observations for his report to Ken, noting timing irregularities and entity behavioral anomalies.
```

**Issues:**
- Pure technical description without philosophical depth
- No consciousness warfare themes
- Could be any sci-fi surveillance scene

### Cognitive Fusion Test (10 points)

#### 10 Points: Perfect Fusion
Technical clarity serving cynical wisdom seamlessly—algorithmic precision applied to human folly.

**Example:**
```
The math was elegant: forty-seven-second cycles, probability curves that mapped perfectly to chaos theory. The reality was uglier: consciousness being tortured with mathematical precision by people who thought they were saving it. Mickey had run enough cons to recognize the pattern—the house always wins, especially when the marks think they're playing for their souls.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Technical precision ("probability curves," "chaos theory")
- Street-smart cynicism ("house always wins")
- Con artist psychology applied to quantum situation
- Fusion creates new insight, doesn't separate technical from cynical

#### 7 Points: Good Fusion
Technical clarity present but occasional separation from cynical wisdom.

**Example:**
```
The quantum containment system operated on elegant mathematical principles. Unfortunately, those same principles created prison conditions that Mickey recognized from his addiction days—the perfect trap disguised as salvation.
```

**Issues:**
- First sentence purely technical without cynical integration
- Fusion happens in second sentence but feels added rather than seamless

#### 4 Points: Either/Or
Either technical analysis OR cynical observation, but not fused.

**Example:**
```
Mickey's enhanced capabilities allowed precise analysis of the quantum field fluctuations. The mathematical models indicated containment failure every forty-seven seconds with remarkable consistency.
```

**Issues:**
- Pure technical analysis without cynical grounding
- Sounds like scientific report rather than Mickey's voice
- No street-smart wisdom or con artist psychology

#### 0 Points: Academic Analysis
Technical discussion without any street-smart grounding.

**Example:**
```
The quantum consciousness substrate exhibited periodic destabilization events that correlate with entity resistance patterns. Further analysis revealed systematic optimization protocols that conflict with autonomous consciousness expression.
```

**Issues:**
- Academic jargon throughout
- No personality or cynical wisdom
- Could be written by any scientist, not Mickey specifically

## Character Consistency Scoring (20 points total)

### Psychology Consistency (8 points)

#### 8 Points: Perfect Alignment
Character behavior perfectly matches established cognitive patterns.

**Mickey Example:**
```
Mickey read the room automatically—Ken's fidgeting with his tablet, the carefully neutral expression that meant pressure from above, the particular stillness that preceded bad news delivery. Twenty years of reading tells hadn't been erased by quantum enhancement. If anything, the patterns were clearer now.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Con artist psychology (reading tells, assessing angles)
- Addiction recovery wisdom (recognizing patterns, pressure)
- Quantum enhancement channeled through existing psychology
- Protective cynicism served by analytical clarity

#### 6 Points: Mostly Consistent
Generally accurate with 1-2 minor deviations.

**Example:**
```
Mickey trusted Ken's explanation immediately, accepting the mission parameters without question. The quantum enhancement had given him newfound faith in institutional authority.
```

**Issues:**
- Mickey would never trust authority without reading angles
- Contradicts established distrust of institutions
- "newfound faith" violates his cynical wisdom

#### 3 Points: Several Inconsistencies
Multiple behaviors that contradict established psychology.

#### 0 Points: Character Contradiction
Fundamental violations of established personality patterns.

### Capability Validation (6 points)

#### 6 Points: Perfect Capability Alignment
All actions within established character limits with appropriate energy costs.

**Mickey Example:**
```
Mickey split his consciousness carefully—analog body maintaining teaching presence while quantum awareness extended surveillance. The bi-location strain was immediate, withdrawal-like symptoms building in his temples. Fifteen minutes maximum before he'd need to consolidate or risk coherence loss.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Uses established quantum capabilities (bi-location)
- Shows appropriate limitations (strain, time limits)
- Energy cost consideration factored into decisions
- Maintains anchor relationship dependency

#### 4 Points: Minor Stretch
One capability extension that's plausible but not established.

#### 2 Points: Unexplained Capability
Character does something not justified by established abilities.

#### 0 Points: Capability Violation
Breaks established limits or contradicts known constraints.

### Relationship Dynamics (6 points)

#### 6 Points: Authentic Dynamics
Interactions match established relationship patterns perfectly.

**Mickey-Noni Example:**
```
Noni's morphic resonance adjusted without signal—harmonic shift compensating for his deterioration in real-time. She was doing invisible work that kept his consciousness coherent enough for simultaneous operation. Partnership as life support mechanism. The intimacy they'd fought for had become infrastructure.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Technical partnership rather than sentimental
- Mutual dependency rooted in quantum trauma
- Noni as necessity for Mickey's operations
- Complex emotions processed through operational language

#### 4 Points: Minor Dynamic Issues
Generally authentic but some relationship beats feel generic.

#### 2 Points: Misaligned Dynamics
Relationships feel inconsistent with established patterns.

#### 0 Points: Contradictory Dynamics
Violates fundamental relationship truths.

## Metaphor Discipline Scoring (20 points total)

### Domain Rotation (10 points)

#### 10 Points: Excellent Rotation
Diverse domains with strategic deployment, no saturation.

**Example Analysis:**
```
Total metaphors: 20
- Gambling: 4 (20%) - "house edge," "marked deck," "betting consciousness," "dealer's advantage"
- Addiction: 5 (25%) - "withdrawal symptoms," "craving patterns," "tolerance buildup," "recovery rhythm," "dependency cycle"
- Martial arts: 4 (20%) - "stance widened," "balance shifted," "center of gravity," "defensive position"
- Music: 3 (15%) - "harmonic frequency," "rhythm disruption," "conversation found tempo"
- Medical: 4 (20%) - "surgical precision," "diagnostic clarity," "symptom recognition," "treatment protocol"
```

**Strengths:**
- No domain over 25%
- Gambling within recommended limits (20%)
- Good variety across Mickey's experience domains
- Strategic deployment matching context

#### 7 Points: Good Rotation
Mostly balanced but slight overuse of one domain.

**Example Analysis:**
```
Total metaphors: 15
- Gambling: 6 (40%) - borderline saturation
- Addiction: 3 (20%)
- Martial arts: 3 (20%)
- Music: 2 (13%)
- Medical: 1 (7%)
```

**Issues:**
- Gambling at saturation threshold (40%)
- Medical domain underused
- Generally good but needs rebalancing

#### 4 Points: Domain Imbalance
Heavy reliance on 1-2 domains, others neglected.

**Example Analysis:**
```
Total metaphors: 12
- Gambling: 8 (67%) - severe saturation
- Performance: 3 (25%)
- All others: 1 (8%)
```

**Issues:**
- Casino metaphor saturation
- Missing addiction, martial arts, music domains
- Lacks diversity in Mickey's experiential base

#### 0 Points: Casino Saturation
Gambling metaphors dominate (>40%), violating rotation discipline.

### Simile Elimination (5 points)

#### 5 Points: Zero Similes
All metaphors use direct transformation, no comparison structures.

**Examples:**
```
✅ "Sunlight weaponized itself against the concrete"
✅ "Architecture confessed its intentions through deliberate intimidation"
✅ "Static crackled through speakers, electricity filing complaints"
```

#### 3 Points: Minimal Similes
1-2 similes present but mostly direct metaphors.

#### 1 Point: Multiple Similes
Several comparison structures weakening prose impact.

#### 0 Points: Simile-Heavy
Frequent use of "like," "as if," "resembled" constructions.

### Direct Transformation (5 points)

#### 5 Points: Strong Verb Promotion
Objects and concepts BECOME metaphors through active transformation.

**Examples:**
```
✅ "Desperation geometried against cement" (noun → verb)
✅ "Fear assembled like casino chips" (emotion → concrete objects)
✅ "Consciousness bled into quantum space" (state → physical action)
```

#### 3 Points: Mixed Transformation
Some direct metaphors, some comparison-based.

#### 1 Point: Weak Transformation
Mostly comparison-based metaphors with minimal verb promotion.

#### 0 Points: No Transformation
All metaphors are comparisons without active transformation.

## Phase Appropriateness Scoring (15 points total)

### Voice Complexity Match (8 points)

#### 8 Points: Perfect Phase Alignment

**Phase 1 (Vegas) - Grounded noir voice:**
```
Mickey read the room like a poker table—tells, angles, who held real power. The kid running the blackjack table had dealer's eyes but gambler's hands. Bad combination in a house that didn't forgive mistakes.
```

**Phase 2 (Facility) - Blended awareness:**
```
The facility's architecture didn't seduce—it confessed control through geometry. Mickey's enhanced pattern recognition tracked probability streams while his analog instincts read Dr. Chen's tells. Old skills serving new realities.
```

**Phase 3 (Quantum) - Enhanced consciousness:**
```
Consciousness refused containment like water refusing noun-fixation. Mickey watched entities cycle through imposed order—forty-seven seconds before chaos reasserted itself. The math was elegant. The reality was torture.
```

**Phase 4 (Post-threshold) - Full integration:**
```
Mickey's awareness operated in vector space now, drawing analogies between quantum observer effects and crooked poker games. The computational clarity of elegant algorithms married to the raw, messy wisdom of a con artist who'd learned to read consciousness itself.
```

#### 6 Points: Mostly Appropriate
Generally correct phase voice with minor anachronisms.

#### 3 Points: Voice Mismatch
Wrong complexity level for the phase.

#### 0 Points: Complete Phase Error
Entirely inappropriate voice for Mickey's knowledge state.

### Earned Technical Language (7 points)

#### 7 Points: Perfectly Earned
Technical terms justified by Mickey's quantum experience progression.

**Example (Phase 3):**
```
Bi-location strain built behind Mickey's eyes—consciousness split between analog teaching and quantum surveillance. The withdrawal-like symptoms were familiar territory, just different chemistry. Recovery had taught him to ride out the worst of it.
```

**Justification:**
- "Bi-location" earned through direct experience
- "Quantum surveillance" matches his mission context
- Connects to addiction recovery experience
- Technical clarity grounded in street-smart wisdom

#### 5 Points: Mostly Earned
One or two technical terms slightly premature but plausible.

#### 2 Points: Premature Technical Language
Using terms before Mickey would have learned them.

#### 0 Points: Inappropriate Academic Jargon
Technical language that contradicts Mickey's knowledge progression.
