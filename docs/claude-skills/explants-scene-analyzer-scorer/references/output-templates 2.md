**Quality Assessment:** [What's working well vs. what needs fixing]
**Enhancement Strategy:** [Surgical fixes for specific violations, NOT wholesale rewrite. Preserve working elements.]
**Narrative Importance:** [Why this scene matters to the overall story]

**Example:**
```
### CONTEXT

**Scene Function:** Mickey witnesses Ben's "game" revealing the consciousness harvesting operation
**Phase:** Phase 2 (Facility) - Mickey understanding the true nature of the project
**Quality Assessment:** Strong character dynamics and thematic work (85/100), dragged down by 6 "with" pattern violations
**Enhancement Strategy:** Surgical fixes only - preserve excellent Ben/Mickey tension and factory metaphor insights
**Narrative Importance:** Critical revelation scene establishing consciousness-as-product theme, sets up Mickey's protective mission
```
