# Pattern Audit Procedures

**Purpose:** Mandatory procedural searches to catch technical violations and formulaic patterns.

---

## Search 1: "with precision" - ZERO TOLERANCE

```
Search term: "with" + "precision"
Acceptable count: 0
Action if found: DELETE every instance
Verification: Search again → must be 0
```

**Why forbidden:** Creates distance between reader and action. Direct verbs are stronger.

**Common violations:**
- "with mechanical precision"
- "with surgical precision" 
- "with practiced precision"

**Fix examples:**
- ❌ "Mickey selected a chip with surgical precision"
- ✅ "Mickey's fingers found the chip automatically"

---

## Search 2: "with [adjective] [noun]" Pattern

```
Search term: " with "
For each match:
  - Check pattern: with + [adjective] + [noun]
  - Examples: "with practiced ease", "with obvious concern"
  - If violation: Embed in verb OR show concrete behavior
Verification: No abstract patterns remain
```

**Formulaic patterns to eliminate:**
- "with theatrical deliberation"
- "with mechanical precision"
- "with practiced ease"
- "with casual indifference"
- "with obvious concern"

**Conversion techniques:**
1. **Embed in action:** "Mickey selected a chip, tapped it three times..."
2. **Direct comparison:** "The mask snapped into place—cool as funeral director's handshake"
3. **Character insight:** "Trevor's fingers counted chips with the precision of a man counting down minutes to his smoke break"
4. **Simple verb:** "She shrugged" (instead of "spoke with casual indifference")

**Acceptable uses:**
- "with his left hand" (literal tool)
- "with the wrench" (physical object)
- "with the document" (concrete item)

## Search 3: Abstract Quality Words

```
Search terms: "efficiency", "grace", "ease", "precision", "concern"
For each match:
  - Context check: Abstract or concrete?
  - Visualization test: Can reader see exact behavior?
  - If abstract: Replace with specific observable details
Verification: All descriptors concrete
```

**Abstract descriptors to flag:**
- "efficiency" → Show specific fast behavior
- "grace" → Show specific smooth movement
- "ease" → Show lack of effort through action
- "precision" → Show exact, measured behavior
- "concern" → Show worried facial expression/gesture

**Conversion examples:**
- ❌ "He moved with practiced ease"
- ✅ "His muscle memory took over"

- ❌ "She spoke with obvious concern"
- ✅ "Her voice cracked on the third word"

---

## Search 4: Academic Meta-Commentary

```
Search terms: "perspective providing", "consciousness couldn't grasp", "understood what"
For each match:
  - Check if AI explaining Mickey vs Mickey thinking
  - Convert to embedded observation
  - Show Mickey's thoughts through actions, not explanation
Verification: No meta-commentary remains
```

**Academic patterns to eliminate:**
- "Enhanced perspective providing clinical analysis"
- "Mickey understood what his consciousness couldn't grasp"
- "Quantum awareness offered insights into the implications"
- "The analysis revealed that consciousness was"

**Conversion examples:**
- ❌ "Enhanced perspective provided clinical analysis of Shanghai's failures"
- ✅ "Mickey watched another extraction attempt collapse in real-time"

- ❌ "Mickey understood what his analog consciousness couldn't grasp"
- ✅ "The pattern clicked into focus"

---

## Search 5: Formulaic Repetition

```
Identify: Any phrase appearing 3+ times
Examples: "Enhanced perspective provided...", "Quantum consciousness..."
Action: Vary constructions, rotate opening structures
Verification: No phrase repeats more than 2x
```

**Common repetitive patterns:**
- "Enhanced perspective [verb]..." → Vary with "Mickey watched," "The pattern," "Quantum signatures"
- "Quantum consciousness [verb]..." → Rotate with "Mickey's awareness," "His enhanced senses"
- "The facility [verb]..." → Vary openings, don't always start with "The"

**Rotation strategies:**
- Vary sentence openings (subject, prepositional phrase, action)
- Use different subjects (Mickey, the environment, specific objects)
- Rotate verb structures (active, passive, embedded action)

## Search 6: Other Critical Patterns

### Simile Check
```
Search: " like ", " as if ", " as though "
Target: 0-2 total similes per scene
Action: Convert to direct metaphors using literal-metaphorical reality
```

**Conversion examples:**
- ❌ "Air vacated his lungs like punctured tires"
- ✅ "Air vacated his lungs—punctured, flat"

### Italics Audit
```
Count: All italic passages
Target: 0-1 per scene maximum
Test: Does italic advance plot or mark character arc?
Action: Cut repetitive or explanatory italics
```

### Word Count Check
```
Compare: Original vs enhanced word count
Target: +5-15% increase maximum
Warning: If +50%, too much enhancement applied
```

### Architectural Metaphor Saturation
```
Search: "architectural", "built into the foundation", "structural"
Target: Max 0-1 per chapter (not per scene)
Action: Rotate structural metaphors, don't overuse
```

## Audit Report Template

```
## Pattern Audit Results:
- Search 1 ("with precision"): X instances → 0 instances ✅
- Search 2 ("with [adj] [noun]"): X violations → 0 violations ✅  
- Search 3 (Abstract descriptors): X abstract → X concrete ✅
- Search 4 (Meta-commentary): X academic → X embedded ✅
- Search 5 (Formulaic repetition): X repeats → X varied ✅
- Search 6 (Other patterns): All checks passed ✅

Scene ready for voice authentication.
```

## Emergency Pattern Fixes

### When Multiple Violations Found:
1. **Prioritize voice authenticity** over technical perfection
2. **Apply surgical fixes only** - don't over-enhance
3. **Preserve compressed original** when in doubt
4. **Test read-aloud flow** after each fix
5. **Stop when authentic Mickey voice achieved**

### Red Flag: Over-Enhancement
If word count increases >25%, you're probably:
- Adding unnecessary description
- Explaining what's already shown
- Converting working phrases to less effective ones

**Solution:** Return to preservation mindset. Only fix genuinely broken elements.

---

## The Verification Standard

**ALL SEARCHES MUST PASS** before scene completion.

**Success marker:** Scene passes technical audit while maintaining authentic Mickey voice and compressed phrasing.

**Remember:** Pattern audit serves voice authenticity, not technical perfection. The goal is Mickey thinking, not AI describing Mickey's thoughts.
