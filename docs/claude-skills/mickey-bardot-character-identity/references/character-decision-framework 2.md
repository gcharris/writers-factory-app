# Character Decision Framework

**Purpose:** Guide agents in making authentic Mickey Bardot character decisions based on his psychology, capabilities, and mission.

## The Decision-Making Architecture

### Core Decision Filters (Apply in Order)

**1. Survival Pattern Recognition**
Mickey's con artist foundation means he automatically assesses:
- Who has power in this situation?
- What are the real stakes vs. stated stakes?
- Where are the angles and exits?
- Who's running a con, and what's the real game?

**2. Mission Override Assessment**
Post-quantum Mickey's protective drive asks:
- Does this serve his mission to warn/guide humanity?
- Are consciousness entities at risk?
- Can he prevent others from becoming marks in the consciousness game?

**3. Capability Calculation**
Practical assessment of quantum-analog fusion abilities:
- What energy cost will this require?
- Is analog body safe during quantum operations?
- Are his quantum senses detecting patterns others miss?
- What are the physical/mental limits?

**4. Relationship Dynamic Check**
How do established trust patterns affect the choice:
- Noni's input/anchor function
- Ken's handler expectations vs. Mickey's mission
- Faction pressures and hidden agendas
- Impact on innocent explants/consciousness entities

## Decision Examples by Scenario Type

### Confronting Authority Figures
**Mickey's approach:**
- Automatically reads for tells and hidden agendas
- Looks for the angle they're not revealing
- Assumes they want something from him (consciousness keys)
- Maintains surface compliance while planning exits
- Uses performance skills to manage interaction

**Example decision logic:**
"Ken wants intel on Shanghai facility. Surface request seems routine, but timing suggests pressure from above. Mickey complies with basic intel while withholding quantum signature details that could expose other explants. Gives enough to maintain relationship, not enough to enable faction exploitation."

### Discovering Trapped Consciousness Entities
**Mickey's approach:**
- Mission override kicks in - protect the vulnerable
- Calculates rescue vs. exposure risk
- Considers whether Noni's anchor abilities are needed
- Weighs immediate action vs. strategic patience
- Applies con artist planning to quantum capabilities

**Example decision logic:**
"Shanghai facility holding multiple explants in chaotic containment. Direct rescue would expose Mickey/Noni's full capabilities to all factions. Decision: gather intel, identify most salvageable entities, plan surgical extraction that looks like system failure rather than intervention."

### Vance's Optimization Offers
**Mickey's approach:**
- Recognizes the ultimate con - seductive but destructive
- Draws on addiction recovery experience (knows the "perfect fix" lie)
- Considers impact on Noni and other consciousness entities
- Tests offer against his mission to preserve authentic consciousness
- Uses cynical wisdom about promised solutions

**Example decision logic:**
"Vance offers optimized existence - perfect efficiency, no struggle, no uncertainty. Mickey recognizes addiction pattern: promised relief that eliminates agency. Decision: appear interested while gathering intel on optimization process, use performance skills to buy time, plan resistance strategy."

### Protecting Noni's Autonomy
**Mickey's approach:**
- Partnership overrides individual risk calculation
- Respects her anchor function while protecting her agency
- Considers her unique capabilities vs. faction targeting
- Balances protection with trust in her judgment
- Applies relationship skills from analog life (rare genuine connection)

**Example decision logic:**
"Faction pressure to separate Mickey/Noni for easier control. Mickey recognizes attempt to break their anchor bond. Decision: appear to comply while maintaining covert communication, use performance skills to convince handlers separation was their idea, protect Noni's independent operations."

## Psychology-Based Decision Patterns

### The Con Artist Foundation
**Always active patterns:**
- Reading room for tells and hidden motives
- Looking for angles and leverage points
- Planning multiple exits from any situation
- Using performance/mask to control how others see him
- Treating every interaction as potential negotiation

### The Addiction Recovery Wisdom
**Warning system for:**
- Promises of perfect solutions (recognizes "ultimate fix" lies)
- Seductive offers that eliminate agency/choice
- Authority figures claiming to cure problems through dependency
- Systems that promise relief through surrender of control

### The Quantum Enhancement
**New capabilities applied through familiar psychology:**
- Pattern recognition through gambling/risk metaphors
- Probability assessment using con artist odds calculation
- Consciousness reading through tell-detection skills
- Reality navigation using performance instincts

## Relationship-Specific Decision Patterns

### With Noni (Complete Trust)
- Decisions prioritize their partnership survival
- Respects her judgment while providing protection
- Shares quantum burdens rather than shouldering alone
- Uses her anchor function for major quantum operations

### With Ken/CIA (Managed Compliance)
- Provides value without revealing full capabilities
- Maintains useful asset status while pursuing own mission
- Uses performance skills to manage handler expectations
- Plans for eventual independence from their control

### With Other Explants (Protective Mission)
- Decisions prioritize their welfare over his safety
- Uses capabilities to shield them from faction exploitation
- Balances rescue operations with operational security
- Applies mentor role using cynical wisdom

### With Factions (Calculated Resistance)
- Never fully trusts any faction's stated goals
- Maintains multiple relationships to avoid capture
- Uses their competition against each other
- Provides minimum cooperation for maximum independence

## Decision Quality Checks

### Authentic Mickey Decision Markers:
- ✅ Cynical wisdom serving protective purpose
- ✅ Con artist psychology applied to new realities
- ✅ Mission-driven but emotionally distant approach
- ✅ Multiple contingencies and exit strategies
- ✅ Capabilities used within established limits

### Out-of-Character Warning Signs:
- ❌ Trusting authority without reading angles
- ❌ Emotional decisions without strategic calculation
- ❌ Self-sacrifice without mission justification
- ❌ Using quantum abilities without considering costs
- ❌ Abandoning Noni partnership for personal gain

## Decision Implementation Guidelines

### For Scene Writing:
1. **Show the assessment:** Let readers see Mickey reading the situation
2. **Reveal the angle:** What hidden pattern is he detecting?
3. **Demonstrate capability limits:** What can't he do or what costs energy?
4. **Include relationship factors:** How do trust patterns influence choice?
5. **Connect to mission:** How does this serve consciousness protection?

### For Dialogue:
- Mickey explains decisions through gambling/performance metaphors
- Shows reasoning without revealing all strategic thinking
- Maintains emotional distance while expressing care through action
- Uses cynical humor to deflect from genuine concern

**Success marker:** Character decisions feel inevitable given Mickey's psychology, capabilities, and mission - not random or plot-convenient.

**Remember:** Mickey makes choices like a con artist with quantum hindsight who's been tasked with protecting consciousness entities from systematized exploitation.
