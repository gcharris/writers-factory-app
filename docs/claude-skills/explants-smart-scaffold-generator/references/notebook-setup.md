# NotebookLM Notebook Setup Requirements

For the Smart Scaffold Generator to work effectively, the NotebookLM notebook must contain all necessary project architectural documents.

## Critical Documents (Must Have)

### 1. ACE Prompt Template ⭐ ESSENTIAL
- **Upload:** Complete Gold Standard Scaffolding Generator prompt
- **Purpose:** NotebookLM references this structure automatically
- **Format:** Markdown document with all sections and variables
- **Note:** Must be uploaded FIRST before other documents

### 2. Master Planning Reference (Architectural Foundation)
- **Content:** Complete Volume 2 & 3 architecture
- **Includes:** Nine-act structure analysis, four-faction structure
- **Purpose:** Provides overall trilogy context and chapter functions
- **Format:** Planning documents, outlines, structural analysis

### 3. Character Profiles (Current States)
- **Characters:** Mickey, Noni, Vance, Ben, Sadie, Richard, Ken, Igor, Liang
- **Content:** Current states per Act, motivations, relationships, capabilities
- **Purpose:** Accurate character context for each chapter
- **Updates:** Must reflect latest character development through story

### 4. Enhanced Mickey Voice Standards
- **Content:** Complete voice guidelines, anti-patterns, metaphor domains
- **Includes:** Phase-specific requirements, italics discipline
- **Purpose:** Ensures authentic Mickey voice in generated scaffolds
- **Reference:** Voice gold standard and authentication tests

## Essential Content Documents

### 5. Volume 1 Complete Manuscript
- **Purpose:** Continuity callbacks, character history, plot references
- **Content:** Full final text of Volume 1
- **Updates:** Replace with final published version when available
- **Usage:** NotebookLM draws specific references for continuity

### 6. Volume 2 Detailed Outline
- **Content:** Act-by-act breakdown, chapter functions, scene dependencies
- **Purpose:** Structural context for each chapter's role
- **Includes:** Thematic progression, character arcs, plot dependencies
- **Format:** Detailed chapter outlines and beat structures

### 7. Philosophical Framework Documents
- **Content:** Consciousness War ideology, three-vector system
- **Includes:** Individual Optimization (Vance), Collective Control (China), Emergent Cooperation (Mickey & Noni)
- **Special:** Mathematical Creation (Ben's hidden vector)
- **Purpose:** Ensures proper philosophical grounding

## Technical Specifications

### 8. Quantum Consciousness Mechanics
- **Systems:** Q5 implants, bi-location, morphic resonance
- **Integration:** SBI protocols, Fractal-Flux Topology
- **Purpose:** Accurate technical context for consciousness tech
- **Detail Level:** Sufficient for story consistency, not exhaustive

### 9. Thematic Foundation Documents
- **Core Concepts:** Consciousness as verb vs. noun
- **Influences:** Donald Hoffman, Federico Faggin foundations
- **Frameworks:** Techno-Feudalism, Cloud Fiefdoms, Allocation Economy
- **Purpose:** Philosophical depth and terminology consistency

## Document Maintenance Workflow

### Initial Setup Priority
1. **Upload ACE template** (CRITICAL - must be first)
2. **Add architectural documents** (master planning, structure)
3. **Upload Volume 1 manuscript** (for continuity)
4. **Add character profiles** (current states)
5. **Include voice guidelines** (Enhanced Mickey standards)
6. **Add philosophical frameworks** (consciousness war, vectors)
7. **Upload technical specifications** (quantum mechanics)
8. **Test with sample query** (verify quality output)

### Ongoing Maintenance
- **Replace scaffolds with final prose** as chapters are completed
- **Update character states** as they evolve through Acts
- **Version control** critical architectural documents
- **Test queries** after major updates
- **Quarterly audits** for accuracy and completeness

### Update Triggers
- **New completed chapter:** Replace scaffold with final prose
- **Character development:** Update character state documents
- **Plot revelations:** Update technical/philosophical documents
- **Voice evolution:** Update Enhanced Mickey voice standards
- **Structural changes:** Update architectural planning documents

## Quality Assurance

### Document Quality Standards
- **Completeness:** All required sections present
- **Specificity:** Detailed enough for accurate synthesis
- **Currency:** Reflects latest story developments
- **Consistency:** No contradictions between documents
- **Accessibility:** Clear structure for NotebookLM parsing

### Testing Protocol
1. **Upload critical documents** in priority order
2. **Test with known working example** (e.g., Chapter 4: Vance's Approach)
3. **Compare output quality** to reference scaffold
4. **Identify gaps** in document coverage
5. **Add missing documents** and retest
6. **Validate terminology** and philosophical accuracy

## Common Setup Issues

### Missing ACE Template
- **Symptom:** Generic scaffold structure, missing sections
- **Fix:** Upload complete ACE prompt as first document
- **Test:** Query should reference template structure

### Insufficient Character Context
- **Symptom:** Shallow character descriptions, missing emotional states
- **Fix:** Add detailed character profiles with current Act states
- **Update:** Reflect latest character development

### No Philosophical Grounding
- **Symptom:** Generic terminology, missing consciousness war concepts
- **Fix:** Upload philosophical framework documents
- **Include:** Three-vector system, consciousness as verb vs. noun

### Poor Continuity
- **Symptom:** No callbacks to Volume 1 or previous chapters
- **Fix:** Upload Volume 1 manuscript and completed chapters
- **Maintain:** Replace scaffolds with final prose as completed

### Weak Technical Context
- **Symptom:** Vague technical descriptions, inconsistent mechanics
- **Fix:** Upload quantum consciousness specifications
- **Detail:** Sufficient for story consistency, not exhaustive

## Success Indicators

Well-configured notebook produces scaffolds with:
- ✅ Precise philosophical terminology
- ✅ Specific character emotional states
- ✅ Detailed technical context
- ✅ Strong continuity callbacks
- ✅ Authentic voice requirements
- ✅ Clear strategic positioning
- ✅ Complete structural sections

## Document Organization Tips

### Logical Grouping
- **Foundation:** ACE template, architectural planning
- **Characters:** All character profiles and relationships
- **Voice:** Enhanced Mickey standards and examples
- **Content:** Volume 1 manuscript, Volume 2 outlines
- **Philosophy:** Consciousness war, vector systems
- **Technical:** Quantum mechanics, system specifications

### Naming Convention
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Group related documents with prefixes
- Version control important documents
- Date major revisions
- Mark "CURRENT" versions clearly

### Update Schedule
- **Weekly:** Check for new completed chapters
- **Monthly:** Update character states and relationships
- **Quarterly:** Audit complete document set
- **As needed:** Add new philosophical or technical developments
