# Quality Checklist for Generated Scaffolds

Use this checklist to validate that NotebookLM output meets Gold Standard requirements.

## Required Sections

A complete scaffold must include all of these sections:

### ✅ Chapter Overview
- **Title:** Clear chapter identifier
- **Target Length:** Word count goal (typically 5,000-6,000)
- **Phase:** Act title and number
- **Voice:** Mickey's emotional/cognitive state for this chapter
- **Core Function:** Dramatic purpose and story role

### ✅ Strategic Context
- **Conflict Positioning:** Role in three-way ideological war
- **Antagonist Goals:** Specific philosophical objectives
- **Thematic Setup:** Key frameworks (e.g., Techno-Feudalism)
- **Protagonist Constraint:** Mickey's current limitations

### ✅ Success Criteria
- **Quality Thresholds:** Specific score requirements (>8.5 overall)
- **Voice Requirements:** Enhanced Mickey standards
- **Technical Integration:** How concepts are filtered through character
- **Philosophical Alignment:** Consciousness war argument service

### ✅ Continuity Checklist
- **Callbacks:** References to previous chapters/Volume 1
- **Character States:** Current emotional/physical conditions
- **Foreshadowing:** Setup for future developments
- **Technical Consistency:** Quantum/consciousness mechanics

### ✅ Multi-Agent Readiness Statement
- Confirmation that scaffold provides sufficient context
- Expected output specifications
- Handoff instructions for scene-writer skill

## Quality Indicators

### Excellent Scaffolds Include:

**Precise Philosophical Terminology:**
- "Utilitarian Colonialism" (Vance chapters)
- "Vector Beta/Gamma" (ideological positioning)
- "Techno-Feudalism" (economic framework)
- "Consciousness as verb vs. noun" (core philosophy)

**Specific Continuity Callbacks:**
- References to Volume 1 events
- Character relationship history
- Previous chapter consequences
- Ongoing plot threads

**Clear Strategic Positioning:**
- Explicit role in trilogy arc
- Three-way conflict dynamics
- Philosophical stakes elevation
- Antagonist motivation clarity

**Embedded Voice Requirements:**
- Voice calibration woven into context
- Not separate exhaustive section
- Phase-appropriate complexity
- Metaphor domain guidance

## Red Flags (Indicates Poor Quality)

### Missing or Weak Elements:

**Generic Language:**
- Vague philosophical terms
- No specific terminology
- Generic "good vs. evil" framing
- Missing consciousness war concepts

**No Continuity:**
- No references to previous chapters
- Character states unclear
- Missing Volume 1 callbacks
- Disconnected from trilogy arc

**Shallow Context:**
- No character emotional states
- Missing technical details
- Generic voice requirements
- No philosophical grounding

**Poor Structure:**
- Missing required sections
- Voice requirements as separate list
- No multi-agent readiness statement
- Unclear success criteria

## Comparison Standards

Generated scaffolds should match the quality and detail level of the reference example. Key comparison points:

- **Depth:** Character context should be as detailed as reference
- **Specificity:** Technical details should be precise, not generic
- **Integration:** Philosophy should be woven throughout, not separate
- **Completeness:** All sections present with substantial content
- **Usability:** Ready for immediate handoff to scene-writer

## Validation Workflow

1. **Section Check:** Verify all required sections present
2. **Terminology Check:** Scan for precise philosophical language
3. **Continuity Check:** Look for specific callbacks and references
4. **Depth Check:** Compare character/technical detail to reference
5. **Integration Check:** Ensure voice requirements embedded, not listed
6. **Usability Check:** Confirm multi-agent readiness statement

## If Quality is Poor

**Common Fixes:**
- Verify all architectural documents in NotebookLM notebook
- Check that ACE template document is uploaded
- Use follow-up query: "Expand with more specific details"
- Ask NotebookLM: "Is that ALL you need for a complete scaffold?"
- Try more specific beat descriptions in input

**When to Regenerate:**
- Missing 2+ required sections
- No philosophical terminology
- No continuity callbacks
- Generic/shallow character context
- Voice requirements as separate list rather than embedded

## Success Markers

A high-quality scaffold will:
- Pass all section and quality checks
- Include precise philosophical terminology
- Reference specific past events and character states
- Embed voice requirements naturally
- Provide clear multi-agent handoff instructions
- Match reference example depth and specificity
