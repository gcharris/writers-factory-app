## What Is This?

Writers Factory is a **professional novel-writing IDE** that enforces structure before freedom. In one intensive week, you'll produce a complete 15,000+ word novella using AI as a creative partner, not a replacement.

> *"We are not just writing a novel; we are engineering a synthetic cognitive system."*

The course offers two tracks:
- **Writer Track**: Focus on creative output. Use the app as-is.
- **Architect Track**: Dive into the codebase. Optimize the Context Engine.

## The Four Modes

Your AI partner (The Foreman) guides you through four distinct phases:

    <div class="card">
        <span class="badge badge-architect">ARCHITECT</span>
        <h3>Story Bible</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">Build your narrative foundation: protagonist, 15-beat structure, world rules, and theme.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <span class="badge badge-voice">VOICE</span>
        <h3>Voice Calibration</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">Train the system to write like you through tournament-style comparison.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <span class="badge badge-director">DIRECTOR</span>
        <h3>Scene Drafting</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">Generate scenes with full context injection from your Story Bible.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <span class="badge badge-editor">EDITOR</span>
        <h3>Polish</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">Check continuity, pacing, and voice consistency across your manuscript.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## What You'll Produce

By the end of the week:

- **A complete novella** (15,000+ words) in your authentic voice
- **A Story Bible** that could guide future work
- **Deep understanding** of AI-assisted creative workflows
- **(Architect Track)** Pull requests improving the system
