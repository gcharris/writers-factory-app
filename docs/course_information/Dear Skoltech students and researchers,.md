Dear Skoltech students and researchers,

ISP planning season is here. Let me introduce something for the systems thinkers.

**"AI and the One-Week Novel"** — an experimental course in applied AI architecture, disguised as a creative writing intensive.

**The Shift:**

Most people still think in terms of **Prompt Engineering** — crafting the right magic words to get a good response.

The smart people have moved on to **Context Engineering** — dynamically assembling the right *state*, *memory*, and *structure* so the model can't get it wrong.

This course teaches the latter.

**The Problem:**

LLMs are stateless. Every API call is a blank slate. This works for chatbots. It fails for long-form generation — a novel requires memory and consistency that no context window can hold.

We've built a system that solves this. You'll learn how.

**The Tech:**

🔹 **GraphRAG** — Knowledge graphs with narrative ontology. Retrieves connected subgraphs, not isolated chunks.

🔹 **Multi-Model Orchestration** — 9+ LLM providers with quality-tier routing and parallel tournament generation.

🔹 **Context Assembly Pipeline** — Dynamic prompt construction from session state, knowledge graph, voice profile, and story structure.

🔹 **Tiered Verification** — Three-tier consistency checking. Catches contradictions before they become plot holes.

**Stack:** SvelteKit, Tauri, Python FastAPI, NetworkX, SQLite, multi-provider LLMs with Ollama fallback.

**Two Tracks:**

✍️ **Writer Track** — Use the system. Produce a novella.

🛠️ **Architect Track** — Improve the system. Submit PRs.

**Format:** 📅 5 days intensive 💻 Bring your laptop

**Fair warning:** 🔻 First-time offering. You're beta testers. 🔻 The domain is creative writing, but the work is engineering.

Dates TBD. If interested, reply or DM.
