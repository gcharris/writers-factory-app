# Writers Factory App (Desktop)

Revamped version of the Writers Factory system as a **desktop-first application**.

This repo will host an offline/desktop experience for AI-augmented writing workflows, building on the core ideas from `writers-factory-core` but optimized for:
- Local-first usage (desktop app shell)
- Tighter integration with file system projects
- Richer UX for scene generation, diagnostics, and revision

## Status

Early setup. Initial scaffolding and architecture to be defined.
