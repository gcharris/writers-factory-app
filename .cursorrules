# Project: Writers Factory Desktop (Graph-Centric IDE)

## Core Philosophy
- **Truth is the Graph:** The NetworkX/SQLite graph is the source of truth, not text files.
- **Hybrid AI:** Use Gemini 3.0 CLI for reasoning/creative tasks. Use local Ollama for simple utility/NER tasks.
- **Architecture:** Tauri (Frontend) + Python FastAPI (Backend).

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Python 3.12, NetworkX, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy (Async), FastAPI.
- Frontend: SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tauri v2.
- AI Bridge: `backend/bridges/gemini_cli.py` (Subprocess wrapper).

## Documentation Reference
- Always refer to `docs/01_architecture.md` for structural questions.
- Always refer to `docs/02_scene_pipeline.md` for logic regarding scene generation and database schemas.

## Coding Style
- Use Python Type Hints strongly.
- Use Pydantic models for all data exchange.
- When writing Python code, ensure it is compatible with the Gemini 3.0 CLI bridge.
