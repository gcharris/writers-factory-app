Mickey lurched into the Director’s reception area, one hand gripping his wheelchair walker. His legs negotiated each step. Balance looked negotiable—gravity more a suggestions rather than a law.

The secretary looked up at the apparition wheeling, half-dragging himself forward.

"I need to see Richard. It's urgent." Mickey's voice carried desperation of someone who'd seen hell and made it back just to sound the alarm.

The secretary half-rose, framed by a cheap poster of The Scream on the wall behind her. At that moment, the fake looked less like Munch and more like an original mashup of her mouth on Mickey’s face.

Richard was pacing behind his desk, tension radiating from every movement. Someone sat in the chair opposite him, back to the door. Mickey burst in, his limping gait and breathless state betraying the physical effort required just to get here.

"You gotta do something. Look, I'll lay it all out for you. Andrea was an explant, now she's controlled by an alpha male chimp in the quantum—"

The words died in his throat as Dee turned in the chair, those unnerving eyes locking onto Mickey's. Terror washed across Mickey's face, his body instinctively recoiling from the man responsible for the horrors he'd witnessed.

*The moment when Mickey learned that salvation and damnation sometimes sit in the same office, discussing your fate.*

"Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I see you already have a visitor..." 

He turned away from Dee's bouncing head and burning eyes, unable to maintain contact with that predatory gaze. Mickey's entire body language transformed—swagger evaporating, confidence hemorrhaging.

"I-I... I'll come back later." His voice dropped to nearly a whisper.

"No, it's quite alright," Richard replied with forced neutrality. "In fact, we were just talking about you."

Mickey's survival instincts kicked in, posture shifting back toward defiance. "I'm honored. And what odds did you give me? What are my chances of escaping his chimps, or having my soul genetically modified and then—"

He pantomimed operating a two-handed joystick, fingers moving with exaggerated precision. The gesture was deliberately provocative—a gambler's bluff when holding a weak hand.

"Squeezed back into my body so I can—"

Richard's face jumped from confusion to anger. "Mickey!—"

"Oh, so you're in this together." Mickey's eyes darted between them, the pieces clicking into place. "He doing your dirty work, or is he joysticking you, too, like he does everyone else around here?"

Richard's finger stabbed at the intercom button. "We need patient restraint—immediately, thank you."

Dee's clinical detachment never wavered as he addressed Richard. "It would appear I was right, Professor. Our patient is experiencing a not unexpected inflammatory reaction, causing hallucinatory brain activity."

The door opened as security guards and an orderly entered. Mickey tried to resist, but his post-implant body answered slow—moves he’d spent years perfecting now had to sit on hold waiting for his call to be answered. Hands secured with nylon cable ties—trained handlers flipped him into his wheelchair.

An orderly prepared a syringe. Dee stepped in, capped the needle before it vanished into his pocket. Secrets somewhere beyond the wobbly head, calibrated smile and darting eyes.

"Thank you, gentlemen. Please take Mr. Bardot to the ward and make sure he is secured there," Richard said. Final. Professional. But the small tremor at the end disclosed a man betraying his own conscience.

"Asshole... destroying everything... chimps... Andrea... squeezing..." Mickey's protests dissolved into fragmented accusations as he was wheeled away, his coherence seemingly breaking down though his eyes remained clear and terrified.

Dee followed behind, his gait oddly fluid despite his condition. Richard's secretary looked at him questioningly as the disturbing procession passed her desk.

"Find me Henry," Richard instructed, his voice heavy with what might have been regret or resignation.

Left alone, Richard stared at the door, his expression one of sad resignation—the face of a man trapped in a situation spiraling beyond his control, looking for someone who might still offer a way out.
