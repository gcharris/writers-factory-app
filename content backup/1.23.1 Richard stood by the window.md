**CHAPTER 23**

Richard pressed the phone tightly against his ear. He couldn't help but imagine himself an explant—the phone implanting itself under his skin—a lifeline to an authority that existed beyond here, beyond now. Permanent salvation—a permanent link to that other world. Anything that could help him escape the position he'd claimed for weeks now, standing by the window in what used to be his office, staring out at what used to be his facility while the real decisions were made behind him through other channels, other calls, other conversations he was no longer part of.

Henry hovered nearby, giving those subtle hand gestures that had become their private language. When to push, when to retreat, when to let Richard think he was making his own decisions. In the corner, Liang stood perfectly still, sorting papers with the kind of focused patience that only comes when you're waiting for exactly the right moment.

*Three men in a room, each playing a different game.*

"One more casualty is not the end of the world," Richard said into the receiver, his voice straining for the weight of command across the digital distance. You could hear him trying to sound like he still ran things. "You tell me what caused it, you're performing the autopsy."

General Paige's voice crackled back through the speaker—clear, distant, and unyielding. "Can't you see, Professor? You're at the end. The virus is multiplying—"

"There is no virus, General!" 

Richard looked to Henry for backup—that reflexive glance of a man who'd gotten used to having his lines fed to him. Henry's subtle nod towards Liang was all Richard needed to continue with the script.

"You've approved Dr. Liang and Dr. Dünkelspühler's travel to the conference in China—"

The mention of his name triggered something in Liang's nervous system—hands going completely still with the focused attention of someone whose moment had finally arrived.

"—Rats from a sinking ship," Paige cut in, the metaphor hanging in the air between them.

Richard made that embarrassed glance toward Liang—the awkward moment when you realize someone might have overheard their own eulogy. Henry kept him on track with another gesture, but you could see the wheels turning behind Liang's careful mask.

"We want to send the yoga and martial arts teachers with them."

Dead air filled the line—Paige wasn't thinking it over, he was running the request through whatever security protocols governed people like Mickey and Noni. When his voice returned, it carried that same distant authority: "They don't have antennas, I assume."

Richard shook his head with the confidence of a man who knew exactly what technologies had been implanted in whom.

"No, they've got the new upgrades," Richard said into the phone.

"Fine by me." The casual dismissal crackled through the speaker.

"And we really need a temporary data link. There's a mass of data, videos, presentations, test results—"

Liang's entire posture shifted into data collection mode—every fiber focused on the response that would determine whether months of careful positioning had generated the access he required.

"No!" The word shot through the line like a verdict, immediate and final.

"Just for a short time—" Richard pressed closer to the phone, as if proximity could bridge the digital distance between him and real authority.

"All digital media must be submitted twenty-four hours in advance—" Paige's voice carried the weight of protocols set in stone, transmitted across frequencies Richard could never access.

"They leave tomorrow," Richard said, his words disappearing into the electronic void.

"Good, anything else?" The question came back as dismissal—the sound of a door closing, transmitted through satellite signals.

Richard's shoulders slumped. The physical manifestation of a man finally getting the memo about his actual position in the hierarchy. He looked to Henry for support and got nothing but a helpless shrug—Henry's own little performance of shared defeat.

Liang's disappointment was brief—a flicker of tactical recalibration before something else took control. The shift from compliance to calculation happened in real time, backup protocols quietly moving to primary status.

"Uh, no, nothing else today, thanks," Richard said into the receiver, each word disappearing into digital static.

The line went dead. He extracted the phone from his ear—not the lifeline he needed.

Liang cleared his throat, cutting through the post-call vacuum. "Director, without the data connection, I can't see how we can properly and honestly..." The pause before 'honestly'—just a bit too long. "...present all the program's results and successes which you have promised to the United Nations. How an American general has the right to stop this!?"

*Using Richard's idealism as leverage for his own agenda. Beautiful work, really.*

Richard lowered the phone, the dead weight of it matching the dead weight in his chest. His office had become a waiting room where other people made the decisions through other channels, other frequencies, other connections he no longer had access to.

Liang smiled, bowed his head politely, and headed for the door. His footsteps quickened beyond the threshold—not panic but purposeful acceleration toward objectives which existed in parallel to the official mission.

After the door shut, Henry observed Richard's collapse with the satisfaction of a systems architect watching his design achieve optimal efficiency. The quiet focus wasn't predatory—it was administrative. The recognition that human consciousness, like any other resource, could be harvested, processed, and redirected toward more productive applications.
