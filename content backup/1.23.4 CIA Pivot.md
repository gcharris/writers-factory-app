Sterile fluorescence bathed Ken Matthews in Langley's institutional glow. The video conference room—windowless, soundproofed, designed for conversations that officially never happened. Split-screen reality: Agency seal on one feed, two figures huddled in UNRCAC's bowels on the other.

Ken's fingers drummed measured percussion against government-issue desk veneer. Forty-eight hours past his last decent sleep. Coffee residue stained the ceramic mug beside him—bitter reminder of the stimulants keeping him functional.

"Status report on Project Incubator," Ken said without preamble. "But first—how long can we continue using these comms while under total lockdown? Is this the same secret channel Liang--?"

Ben's response came before Ken had finished. "Yes. Same channel Liang's using for his Shanghai transfer. Igor's P2P network through Moscow. We're positioned for intercept."

Ken's eyebrow lifted—professional skepticism engaging. "Russian infrastructure?"

"Ironic, but effective." Henry leaned into frame, bureaucratic calm masking calculated misdirection. "They trust it precisely because they think it bypasses our monitoring. Liang already has access to the backup channel—the team is in position."

The setup felt too convenient. Ken's gambling instincts—honed through decades of reading tells across interrogation tables—registered microscopic inconsistencies in what he was hearing. Nothing prosecutable. Just wrong frequencies, like a dealer's shuffle slightly off rhythm.

*The moment when intelligence agencies discover they're marks in someone else's con.*

"And the package itself?" Ken asked. "What's our move?"

"Strip out Zaitsev's Fractal-Flux framework and forward a neutered package to Shanghai." Henry's explanation carried clinical precision. "They get a crippled weapon, won't know why it's useless."

"Clean extraction?" Ken kept his tone flat, professional.

"I have the protocols," Ben confirmed. "Without Fractal-Flux, their quantum environment becomes uncontrollable chaos."

Ken nodded—green light granted with bureaucratic efficiency. "Neuter the package and let it fly."

"That's not all, sir." Ben cut through Ken's attempts at agency tech-speak. "For weeks, Dee's had me running what I thought was high-stakes simulation. But when I managed to get the new piggyback protocol working on the Q5 chip, I saw the truth."

Ken's head pivoted side to side. "Remind me about this piggyback thing; whose idea was it, and who's done the technical development work? Last time I talked to Richard about this he told me this was pure fantasy—impossible and against ethical guidelines."

Ben knew that Ken knew about the extensive training—a room with too-bright lights, electrodes tracing every involuntary twitch, protocol drills so relentless that lies and truth blurred into the same steady rhythm. Each question back then was a rehearsal for today, where his loyalty to the Agency ran parallel to quiet deals with Vance, never crossing lines but always circling them.

Ben smiled and chuckled. "There are some incredibly smart guys working in this place you know." Did Ken know? 

*Some cons force you to play both sides—today, Ben played to the silent audience behind the mirrored glass.*

Ben pulled a tablet into camera range—screen displaying raw visual feed from quantum space. Surreal landscape of pulsing geometric structures. Energy fields—shimmering, unstable—swirled through a magical environment. One bouncing sphere coalesced and stabilized like a drunk learning to walk.

"This is from the piggyback," Ben explained, tension threading his words. "That's Mickey. He's learning to navigate, exist in there. But he's a rookie."

Screen swiped. Viewpoint shifted to brilliant golden light—fluid grace, environmental manipulation, defensive fields of energy. Other smaller lights coordinated around the central figure like backup singers finding their harmony.

"She's a natural. Not just fighting back—leading. The system's too alive, too emergent to be controlled from outside."

Ben leaned closer. "We've been thinking about this wrong. Don't just deny them the tech. We need to compete inside it. We need our own operators. That's why I recruited Mickey—first man on the inside."

Ken stared at dual feeds—exhaustion warring with incredulity. Long silence stretched between encrypted connections. When he finally spoke, acid disbelief corroded every syllable.

"Let me get this straight, Ben. You're proposing a fundamental strategic pivot... based on insights you gleaned from what you thought was a video game?"

"It's not a game, sir." Ben's frustration bled through digital compression like blood through gauze. "Live theater of operations. We've been interacting with real human consciousnesses."

"And you've taken it upon yourself to act on this discovery?" Ken's gaze sharpened—prosecutor mode engaging. "Recruited an asset? Mickey? Without authorization?"

"I made a judgment call, sir. 

"I'll say." Ken leaned back, rubbing his temples.

"They're trying to get these test subjects ready to go to Shanghai, and I thought if I could maintain the piggyback--" Ben saw Ken clearly. He'd been trained to know when to stop.

"Look, this is... a lot. Complete rewrite of our mission. That's a decision made on the top floor, not by me on secure VTC. I need to talk to the Director. Need to understand ramifications of sending our people into this 'live theater.'"

His gaze shifted between Ben and Henry—measuring loyalties, calculating risks like a pit boss reading players across multiple tables. "For now, primary objective remains unchanged: deny them the software. Do not engage. Do not recruit. Is that understood? I'll get back when I have guidance from the Director."

Henry stepped in, hand finding Ben's shoulder. The gesture was simultaneously supportive and restraining—the trainer calming an overager fighter. "We understand, sir. Sometimes our gamers get so immersed they forget which world they're supposed to be saving."

Cynical observation hung in digital static. Ben's muscles bunched under Henry's grip—tension coiling like casino spring-loaded mechanisms. Sharp inhale, mouth opening to speak, but Henry's fingers applied precise pressure. Ben's jaw clicked shut. Controlled breath released through nostrils. Eyes fixed forward with parade-ground discipline.

"And on the subject of saving worlds—the one we're currently standing in is proving difficult. The Army's security protocols around the facility are... aggressive. It's making our primary objective difficult. If you could make a call, grease a few wheels at the Pentagon, it would give us more operational flexibility."

Ken's face hardened—patience exhausted, professional mask slipping like cheap veneer. "Negative, Henry. The Director was clear: our footprint there is nonexistent. You are on your own. Do not let anything blow back on the Agency."

Transmission ended. Digital connections severed. But some channels run deeper than wires.

"Thank you, Ben for going beyond the call of duty." Sphinx smile as Henry opened the door. As an afterthought wrapped in casual concern. "Ben—that network efficiency you mentioned. Make sure we understand exactly why it's working so well."

Ben's expression remained neutral. Government-issue furniture. "Will do."

The echo of footsteps was swallowed by acoustic panels, leaving only the hum of sanctioned (or unsanctioned) secrets.”

Ben waited until silence confirmed solitude, then produced different device entirely. Sleeker hardware, military-grade encryption that made CIA equipment look crude by comparison. The real communicator. The one that mattered.

"Reporting in," he said quietly. "Package intercept is green-lit."

"Status?" came a familiar voice through the encrypted connection.

"They're completely unaware the network belongs to you. Igor still thinks it's his Moscow contact, Langley thinks it's Russian military infrastructure, and the Chinese trust it because they think it bypasses Western monitoring."

"Perfect. Continue the operation. And Ben?"

"Yes, sir?"

"Remember who really signs your paychecks."

Ben ended the call and secured the device. Another player in games where power always wins, no matter which agency you serve.

*The perfect con: when every mark thinks they're the one running the game.*
