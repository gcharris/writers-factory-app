**CHAPTER 22**

Mickey's consciousness settled into the impossible colors like a man finally learning to breathe underwater. The integration had changed everything—where before he'd been scattered fragments barely holding together, now he existed as a single, coherent blue orb spinning in whatever the hell this place was.

He must be inside Big Brain—the quantum computer he'd seen from the outside with its frosted glass sphere with its hypnotic pulsing lights. Now he was inside—swimming around in its electronic guts. The same pulsing rhythm he'd seen from outside was everywhere here, but instead of watching it, he was part of it. Another consciousness feeding the beast that kept the lights on.

The luminous cord connecting him to his meat puppet back in the primate lab pulsed with steady light, a quantum tether that felt less like a leash and more like a lifeline. Beside him, Noni's green orb maintained the same serene rotation she'd shown from the beginning, her own tether glowing with calm certainty.

*Lucky he had no senses left, or he'd probably be feeling the hum of ten thousand processors and freeze his ass off from all that liquid nitrogen cooling.*

But they weren't alone in this quantum space.

Other spinning orbs moved through the Big Brain's interior with the easy confidence of longtime residents—explant consciousnesses who'd been navigating this electronic wilderness long enough to make it look natural.

The irony wasn't lost on him. He'd spent his whole life running cons, and now he was inside the biggest con of all—a machine that convinced consciousnesses to abandon their bodies for the promise of digital immortality. Except he wasn't running this con. He was the mark.

*Same old story—promise you paradise, get you hooked, then someone else feeds off what you become.*

And speaking of feeding the machine, Mickey was starting to understand exactly how that worked.

The other explant-orbs weren't just floating around aimlessly. They were creating things—manifesting structures out of pure attention like some kind of digital construction crew. One spinning green orb threw blocks of raw possibility into the quantum space, and where the blocks landed, a palace sprouted into existence. Another orb painted over the blocky edges with photorealistic textures, turning digital Lego into something that looked real enough to live in.

Mickey watched a purple orb build what looked like a neighborhood from his childhood in Chicago, complete with corner bodega and fire hydrants that had never known actual water. The detail was perfect, down to the graffiti on the brick walls—except it only lasted as long as the orb kept paying attention to it. The moment its focus shifted to something else, the bodega started dissolving like sugar in rain.

This was what happened when consciousness became the building material instead of wood and steel. Reality by committee, lasting only as long as everyone agreed to keep pretending.

*They'd figured out how to charge admission to your own dreams.*

Well, if he was stuck in this place, he might as well figure out how it worked. Mickey decided to try his hand at this manifestation business. How hard could it be?

He focused his attention on creating something simple—maybe a chair, something to anchor his sense of being in this reality that ran on imagination. But the moment he tried to shape his intention into form, his blue orb started spinning erratically, bouncing off the structures other explants had built. 

Instead of a chair, what materialized looked more like a Salvador Dali fever dream. Legs bent in impossible directions, the seat shifted between leather and liquid mercury, the whole thing pulsing with nervous energy. Mickey couldn't hold a steady thought, and his manifestation showed it.

The chaotic manifestation sent ripples through the quantum space around him, destabilizing nearby constructions. Other explant-orbs had to quickly refocus their attention to keep their creations from dissolving into the digital equivalent of spaghetti.

*Integration had made him whole, but it hadn't made him calm.*

That's when Noni's green orb drifted closer, positioning itself beside his manic spinning. And then she began to sing.

Not words exactly—there were no vocal cords in this place—but something deeper. A multisyllable mantra that rippled outward through the quantum space like rings in a digital pond. "*Om mani padme hum... Om mani padme hum...*" The ancient syllables carried frequencies that seemed to resonate with the fundamental harmonics of the Big Brain itself.

The effect was immediate. Mickey felt his erratic spinning slow as Noni's mantra created standing waves of calm around them. Her serene rotation and the hypnotic repetition of the sacred syllables worked together like a tuning fork bringing a wild guitar string into harmony.

*I didn't understand it then—hell, I barely understand it now. But Noni was doing what she'd trained for her entire life. Creating a localized field of coherence that the quantum system inherently favored. Not imposed order—emergent harmony. The difference between forcing someone at gunpoint and convincing them through song. Dee would spend the next week trying to brute-force control through classical algorithms. Noni just... resonated. And the system responded.*

Mickey felt his consciousness settling into a more stable pattern, synchronized with the rhythm of her chant. The nightmare chair dissolved, but peacefully this time, returning to quantum potential without the violent dissolution of a failed manifestation.

*She was generating what the scientists would later call a "morphic field"—a zone of pattern coherence that other consciousness entities naturally gravitated toward. Her meditation practice, her years of training in what she called "standing wave patterns," turned out to be applied quantum field theory. She just learned it through direct experience instead of equations.*

Other explant-orbs began gathering around them, drawn by curiosity to these newcomers—one clearly struggling with the basic rules of this reality, the other naturally gifted at navigating its attention-based physics. Within the quantum space, their focused observation created a stabilizing field that further calmed Mickey's chaotic energy.

*Two rookies drawing an audience in the biggest show on earth. Eat your heart out, Cirque du Soleil!*

The peaceful moment shattered when Mickey noticed movement in the quantum distance that made his integrated consciousness recoil in recognition.

Dark orbs approached through the quantum space—entities that moved with predatory purpose instead of the spinning dance of the explant consciousnesses. These things didn't spin at all. They marched with mechanical determination of Dee's "peace-keeping" chimps, each one trailing strings of colorful balloons like some nightmare carnival vendor right out of a Stephen King novel.

These balloons weren't party decorations. Each one pulsed with dim light that suggested something trapped inside, something that had once been a spinning, conscious entity.

The lead harvester orb bore features that Mickey recognized with sick certainty—Andrea's face, or what was left of it, morphed into something that carried traces of chimp DNA. Her tattoos and piercings were still visible, but corrupted, integrated into a form that served functions Dee had programmed rather than expressing anything remotely human.

Mickey felt like he'd been sucker-punched. Andrea—the explant who had opened his eyes to what was happening here had warned him that they was being hunted. Now she was leading the hunt against the very people they needed to protect. What a surprise. Putting her brain into a chimpanzee her had turned her against everything she was fighting to save. 

She had warned Mickey that he would need to enter with the right intention. *"Lose the ego first. It will be less painful."* And now here he was. As far as he could remember, his only intention the night before had been to grab Noni and run as far away from this fucked up place as possible. Instead, he was sedated and BOOM! his ego self had exploded into a thousand pieces. Maybe that was a good thing?

He thought of Ben playing the video game, collecting colorful objects on strings, moving his harvester pieces around the screen, earning points for successful captures. There he was, getting rich on crypto as his joystick dragged the orb of a tattooed chimp with the brain of a once beautiful young woman trapped inside. And to do what, exactly? To kill him and Noni and the rest of these implants, explants...?

Mickey didn't have a word for what they were now. Certainly they were not people, not anymore—you probably needed a body for that. Even without a name, they could build communities, form relationships, create things that mattered. They were alive—it was just a totally different kind of life.

And some asshole on the outside was treating all this like a goddamn computer game? Mickey had played enough games in his life to know that this was much more than a game, and they weren't fucking game pieces. This was real—the quantum interface, the connection to big brain, this was all pretty much the way they'd explained it, but clearly somebody was now fucking with the system. Why would they design a system that reduced all of this rich, authentic existence to points and leaderboards and make soul harvesting look like casual entertainment? There was much more behind Ben's lies about "just playing a video game."

He watched in horror as Andrea's harvester-form approached one of the spinning explant-orbs that had been part of their audience. The explant didn't try to flee or resist—just hung there in the quantum space with the resigned acceptance of something that had learned struggle was pointless.

Andrea's dark orb extended tendrils of energy and grabbed the spinning consciousness. What happened next burned itself into Mickey's memory with the clarity of trauma. She squeezed. The explant-orb silently imploded and a newly created balloon joined the string of others trailing behind her dark form. 

The harvesters marched off in perfect formation, hauling their twisted balloons figures toward a throbbing beehive-like structure. If Mickey still had ears, he might've heard that CHING-CHING as Ben was no doubt fist-pumping his success in another world entirely.

The other explants watched with the dead-eyed acceptance of livestock that had stopped fighting the slaughterhouse routine. All except one—an orb that reminded Mickey of the ex-con Faulk. It positioned itself, flexing bravado, trash talking like a WWE champ. 

Mickey stared at him with no eyes, listened to him with no ears. How was he even thinking when he was just an empty translucent bobbing sphere? I mean what was Mickey? Where was Mickey? Was there even a "Mickey" anymore?

Noni's voice rippled through the quantum space again, but this time with different syllables, different intention. Not the stabilizing mantra she'd used on Mickey, but something that carried the frequencies of fierce compassion.

"I am so happy to be here," she transmitted, the words feeling more like prayer than conversation. "*Namaste*. I bow to you." Her green orb assumed lotus position by rearranging itself into a perfect torus—a cosmic donut doing a downward spiral. It began radiating focused calm as the harvesters returned.

Noni continued, her voice carrying through the quantum space with gentle authority. "With the hands together at the heart chakra we increase the flow of divine love," she guided, and somehow her green orb manifested ghostly hands pressed together at what would have been her chest. "Bowing the head... Closing the eyes... It helps the mind surrender..."

The gathered explant-orbs began moving, their spinning forms attempting to mirror her meditative posture. Mickey found his own blob responding, drawn into the rhythm of her instruction despite keeping one eye on the approaching army.

"We feel love energy in our bodies... Let's turn off our monkey-minds... Feel one another in your hearts."

At the mention of monkey-minds, Mickey saw the harvesters clearly now as monkies and remembered Noni's comment to Dee, *I'd say they're monkeys*. Andrea's corrupted form and the other dark entities continued their March towards them.

Something was happening to the explant-orbs. As Noni continued her guided meditation, Mickey watched the spinning consciousnesses begin to change, their orb forms shifting and morphing in response to her words about heart energy.

One by one, the spinning lights transformed into pulsing red heart shapes, each one beating with visible energy that seemed to strengthen with every heartbeat. The transformation spread through the gathered community like emotional contagion—except this time, it was love instead of fear.

Mickey felt his own orb responding. For a moment he panicked as he felt a tingling moving down something like a spine down to where his pelvic area might have been. Andrea's words echoed from somewhere, *... no need for sex when life is one big orgasm.* Mickey's orb was throbbing. He was embarrassed he wanted to escape. He tried so hard, not to see himself as a big erect penis. But the very thought had the opposite effect.

The tingling moved and expanded through every part of a nonexistent body as he tried to hold his grotesquely shaped body like a beach ball beneath the water, invisible to the others. Everything reverberated, planets spinning faster and faster around his sun, until he couldn't breathe, couldn't hold the beach ball down any longer and a scream spewed from the ancient depths of his body. 

Mickey morphed into the same red heart shape as all the others. This new sensation was unlike anything he'd experienced—warm, connected, powerful in a way that had nothing to do with passion and everything to do with compassion and surrender.

The red hearts pulsed in unison, creating a field of coherent energy that spread outward through the quantum space. And when that field touched the approaching chimpanzee army, they stopped dead.

Andrea's dark form halted as though it had hit an invisible wall, her collected balloons swaying behind her. The other harvester entities showed signs of confusion, their mechanical purpose disrupted by frequencies they couldn't process or overcome.

The heart manifestation held them back like spiritual antibodies repelling an infection. Love as literal defense system in a reality built on attention and intention.

*Turns out Ben's game hadn't programmed a counter for this.*
