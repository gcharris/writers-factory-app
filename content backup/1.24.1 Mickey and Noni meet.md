## CHAPTER 24

Evening shadows stretched across the common room as Mickey and Noni sat in wheelchairs. Their movements carried deliberate weight—bodies that felt foreign after quantum space. Bandages wrapped the backs of their heads, white gauze catching the fading light.

"How do you feel?" Noni asked, each word carefully formed as if she was rediscovering language.

Mickey's face brightened with genuine wonder, free from his usual performative mask. "I feel... that's it, I feel. For the first time in my life, I can feel without being consumed by it. Pain, pleasure—it's here, I can observe it, but I don't need to react to it. It's me in control. No, not *me*, me. You know, the other me. You get me right?"

It was unclear whether Noni did get him. She couldn't stop laughing, long enough to answer.

Mickey thought. At least he tried to think—or think about what thinking was, until he was too dizzy to continue. 

Noni's laughter subsided in in near-seriousness. "That has been the goal of all spiritual seekers since the time of Buddha." Noni's eyes showed recognition—her path of meditation and his path of chaos had somehow led to the same destination.

Mickey focused on her face, his gaze more direct than it had ever been. "So you are at home there. More than here."

*Some awakenings arrive not with thunder, but with dizziness and laughter. Even Mickey couldn’t bluff feeling, once the chips were off the table.*

"Sinatra must have a song about it," Noni replied unable to fully stop laughing.

Trying his best not to catch Noni's contagious laughter, Mickey closed his eyes. Without warning, a whole universe of living songs filled his universe. He grabbed the one he needed, and breathed in the Sinatra persona—

“*Why try to change me now?*” 

“Why try to change us now, right?” Noni grabbed her bandaged head. 

Mickey keeps the tune. I*'m sentimental, so I walk in the rain/I've got some habits, even I can't explain/Go to the corner, I end up in Spain*. 

Noni joined him in last line—*Why try to change me now?*

They sank back in their wheelchairs, exhausted, but still giggling.

A shadow crossed Noni's expression. "It's not as it should be, is it? Someone is watching us there, aren't they?"

"Monkey minds always interfere with the spiritual quest." Her metaphor bridged her spiritual practice and their current reality. "Perhaps the military *should* just pull the plug?"

Something deeper surfaced in Mickey's eyes—not the old fighter, but something more resolute. "Some of us aren't ready to abandon what we've found. People are trapped in there."

He tried to move quickly, but his body betrayed him, responding with sluggish reluctance. The connection between intention and action felt different now.

"So you can hook up with Andrea?" The edge in Noni's voice was sharp enough to cut glass.

Mickey's grin turned wicked. "She's a poor girl trapped in a male chimpanzee's body, what do you want from me? Besides, jealousy looks good on you, Noni. Very... spiritual."

*The same dangerous charm, but now it served connection instead of conquest.*

Noni's brow furrowed as connections formed. "You said Dee took out the chimpanzee's device. So what is Andrea doing there? How can he control her in the quantum world?"

"I tried to explain it. About Ben's game—the one he's been playing for Dee. Harvesting souls. But now I realize it's more than that. Dee has harnessed the chimpanzees and he is using them to get us all to that beehive thing." He shook his head. "I don't know exactly how he's doing it, but he has total contro over the Andrea chimp."

"Mickey, I want out." Her voice carried sudden finality. "Like, for real. Not just from quantum space—the whole game. I'm done here."

Mickey's half-grin surfaced, but something was different about it—less armor, more invitation. 

"Noni, this isn't Hotel California..." His voice went midnight-radio as he hummed the melody, then improvised: "Welcome to the Hotel... call it BrainJob, such a lovely place, bandages on your face..." 

The absurdity of it made her smile despite everything. “Plenty of room at the BrainJob Hotel, but check out’s a bitch.”

"But hey, you can always pull the plug." A dangerous smile play at his lips. "It's your signature move, Run when things get interesting." 

Mickey struggled up from his wheelchair, grabbing it from behind like a walker. He started pushing off, the playful mask now traded for quiet resolve—laughter gone, purpose pressing in.

"Where are you going?" Anger and panic replacing jollity.

"We need to get Dee and his chimps out of the quantum world. I have to explain it all to Richard." His face settled into resolve—the hustler finally finding a purpose beyond self-preservation.

"Be careful. When will I see you?" The question held layers of meaning.

"Soon, on the other side." He moved toward the door but slowed as Noni stumbled to hug him. Their hands found each other, fingers intertwining with intimacy. Something in their countenance suggested things happening in a space beyond,

"By the way, Noni..." Mickey paused at the threshold, his voice dropping to that register that had always been trouble. "You were extraordinary in there. Watching you move through quantum space was like... watching lightning learn to dance. When we're out of here, I want you to teach me everything."

"Careful, I'm reading your thoughts—" A blush spread across her cheeks, and for a moment she looked exactly like the woman who'd been so dismissive of him on the journey here. It all seemed so very long ago. Now she wasn't dismissing anything.

"Oops." Mickey's grin was pure sin. "Caught me. Though after sharing consciousness with you, I'm not sure I want privacy back. You're much more interesting on the inside than you let on, meditation girl."

At the doorway, he turned back, his expression grave with purpose. "Get your gang together and meditate hard. Try to pull back these stolen souls. There've been over a hundred humans implanted, and there's no more than twenty of us in the quantum space right now. There could be eighty souls that need to be released from wherever Ben and Dee have imprisoned them."

Noni watched him go, her meditation-trained focus returning as she prepared for the battle ahead.
