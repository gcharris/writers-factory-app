Mickey's meat puppet—the body he'd abandoned in that wheelchair—threw one hell of a tantrum while his consciousness was learning to swim in quantum space.

From wherever he was learning to exist, Mickey could sense his abandoned flesh fighting every step of the integration. Spasms started in his fingers and worked their way inward like withdrawal in reverse, building to full-body convulsions that tested every restraint keeping the empty shell upright.

*The meat was taking the quantum education harder than the mind had.*

Deep, animal sounds poured from his throat—not words, not even human noise, just raw brain-stem howling that bypassed thirty years of learning how to speak. His nervous system was trying to process experiences no nervous system was designed to handle, like forcing a rotary phone to run the internet.

Sweat poured off him in rivers, dark patches spreading across his chest and back. The abandoned body was falling completely apart while the real Mickey was elsewhere, learning to be something new.

Beside him, Noni's meat sat in perfect meditation posture, breathing deep and regular like she was in some peaceful garden instead of getting her consciousness rewired by technology that shouldn't exist. Her hands rested on the armrests, palms up, fingers curved just so—the mudra of receptive awareness that she'd practiced for years without knowing she was training for this exact moment.

*Even their abandoned flesh told the story of who they'd been.*

Mickey's meat convulsing like a hooked fish while Noni's remained still as a statue. His body fighting the process every step of the way, hers accepting whatever came with the serenity of someone who'd spent half her life learning to let go.

A small trickle of blood leaked from Noni's left nostril—the only sign that her calm came with a price. The bright red drop traced down her upper lip before disappearing into the fabric of her hospital gown. Even peaceful surrender could draw blood in this place.

Ben watched the monitors with the focused intensity of someone trying to keep two experimental aircraft from crashing. Mickey's vitals spiked and dipped like a fever chart from hell—heart rate climbing toward cardiac territory before plunging back down, blood pressure swinging between stroke and shock.

The quantum interface readings told a different story: successful integration, consciousness transfer complete, new neural pathways forming at impossible speeds.

*The real Mickey was learning to breathe underwater while his old body was drowning in air.*

Then, as suddenly as it had started, Mickey's abandoned body went still. Not the stillness of death—the monitors showed everything still running—but the stillness of a machine finally accepting its new programming. The convulsions stopped. The howling faded to normal breathing.

The meat had learned to house something that was no longer scattered fragments, but something integrated. Something whole.

*Mickey Bardot had integrated. All the scattered pieces had come home.*
